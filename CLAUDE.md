# CLAUDE.md — WOWStudio Accessibility Remediation

Operating brief for Claude Code. **Read `SPEC.md` for the detail** — but read the
"Superseded" block at the top of it first, because the tiering and AI sections of
that document describe a product that no longer exists. The licensing sections
are not merely superseded but deleted, in 0.29.0, along with the last traces of
the SDK itself. This file is the short list of rules and context that always
apply, and where the two disagree, this file wins.

## What we're building
A **real-remediation** WordPress accessibility plugin that finds, fixes and
documents WCAG issues at the **code level**. Publisher:
**WOWStudio**. **Published**: 1.0.4 is live in the WordPress Plugin Directory at
`wowstudio-accessibility-remediation`, approved 2026-09-22 after three review
rounds. The phase is now maintaining a listed plugin rather than reaching for
one — see `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` for how a release actually gets there,
and for the two obligations that keep it listed.

Positioning: *"helps you find, fix and document"* — never *"makes you
compliant."*

**Do not say "monitor" in the free plugin.** Monitoring was built free in
0.21.0 and moved to the paid add-on in 0.22.0; the word came out with it,
because a header advertising something the plugin does not do is the same
species of claim the guard in `bin/check-claims.php` exists to stop. If
monitoring ever returns to free, the word comes back with it and not before.

## There is one plugin, and it is free
As of 0.16.0 there is **no paid tier, no licensing SDK, and no AI**. Everything
in the plugin is free and nothing is gated. Do not add a locked control, an
upgrade prompt, a usage cap, or a tier check.

A paid add-on is planned but not started. It will be a **separate plugin that
attaches to this one**, never a stripped build of it — so the free plugin ships
complete and nothing is ever taken away from anybody who already had it. The
frozen `Pro` branch and `PRO-NOTES.md` hold that plan; the tag
`pro-seed-0.15.1` is the last tree containing the removed licensing and AI code.

**The line, for when it matters: never gate finding. Gate automation,
deliverables, and marginal cost.** Withholding a check means telling somebody
their site has a barrier that will not be described until they pay, and the
person who loses that trade is the disabled visitor rather than the site owner.
Every check, every severity, every post type, and the site-wide scan stay free.

## Non-negotiable product rules (never violate)
1. **Assist, never guarantee.** No string, label, doc, or marketing output may
   say "compliant," "ADA/EAA compliant," "lawsuit-proof," "certified," or
   "100%." Use "helps you find / fix / document." (Legal-risk
   critical — the accessiBe/FTC precedent.) Enforced by `bin/check-claims.php`.
2. **Not an overlay.** Never inject a front-end accessibility widget or
   toolbar. No font-size control, contrast switcher, greyscale mode, or
   link-highlighter. These were considered and deliberately rejected on
   2026-09-06: they fix nothing, the browser and OS already do all of them
   better, and shipping one would forfeit the accessibility community whose
   judgement this product is built to earn. Fixes are real markup and style
   changes.
3. **Human-in-the-loop.** Every automated fix is a reviewable suggestion with
   preview + diff + undo. Nothing irreversible happens silently.
4. **Honesty about coverage.** Always tag issues `auto-detected` vs
   `needs manual review`; state that automation covers only part of WCAG.
   Enforced by `bin/check-disclosures.php`.
5. **Draft, attested docs.** Conformance reports render as DRAFTs the user
   reviews and attests to — the plugin never asserts conformance itself.
6. **Dogfood.** The plugin's own admin UI must pass WCAG 2.2 AA.
7. **No outbound requests.** The plugin contacts nothing. No API, no account,
   no telemetry, no phone-home. This is now a feature we advertise, and adding
   a request would break a promise in `readme.txt`.

See `SPEC.md` → "Explicitly NOT included (anti-features)" for the full stop-list.

## Tech stack
- WordPress ≥ 6.8. PHP ≥ 8.1 (held there deliberately on 2026-09-06 despite the
  competitor's 7.4 floor; the rewrite cost across `src/` is not worth the
  install-base gain). PSR-4 autoload via Composer.
- Admin UI: React via `@wordpress/scripts` (`@wordpress/components`, `data`,
  `api-fetch`). Gutenberg block for the accessibility statement.
- Background jobs: **Action Scheduler** (never block an admin request).
- Storage: custom tables via `dbDelta`; settings in options; per-post scan cache
  in postmeta.
- Charts are hand-rolled accessible SVG. Do not add a charting library: the
  canvas ones draw pixels a screen reader cannot see, which is not defensible
  inside an accessibility plugin.

## Naming & conventions
- Namespace `WOWStudio\AccessibilityKit` · function/hook prefix `wsak_` · DB
  tables `wp_wsak_*` · text domain `wowstudio-accessibility-remediation` · license
  GPLv2+.
- Repo layout, data model, and REST routes are defined in `SPEC.md`.

## Where the work is
Roughly in order. The competitor ships 44 checks and 11 free site-wide fixes;
we ship 41 checks (36 on the server, 5 in the browser pass), 14 site-wide fixes
and 4 one-click fixes, so we are ahead on both.

1. **Checks, 40 → ~48.** Twelve landed in 0.17.0: alt text that is a file name,
   a placeholder or a repeated caption; alt long enough to be a paragraph;
   image-map regions with no name; links that open a new tab or download a file
   without saying so; in-page links and ARIA references pointing at ids that do
   not exist; anchors that click but cannot be tabbed to; empty headings; pages
   with no headings at all; labels attached to nothing or doubled up.

   Eleven more in 0.18.0: empty table headers, unnamed image buttons,
   duplicate ids, positive tabindex, viewports that block zooming, blinking and
   marquee, justified text, underlines that are not links, bold paragraphs
   standing in for headings, video with no caption track, and audio with no
   transcript.

   Still to come: tiny text (needs the browser pass — it is a computed size,
   not a declared one), carousels, and animated GIFs, which means reading frame
   counts out of the file rather than guessing from the extension.

   **Every new rule needs a pair of tests**, one that trips it and one on the
   nearest correct markup that must not. `tests/Unit/ContentRulesTest.php` is
   the pattern. A check that fires on everything is worse than no check: it
   trains people to skim past the findings that matter.
2. **Site-wide fixes.** Nine shipped in 0.19.0: skip link with its target,
   focus outline, link underline, `lang`/`dir`, page title, comment and search
   labels, new-window warning, download file info, block PDF uploads. They live
   in `src/SiteFixes/` behind the `wsak_site_fixes` filter.

   Five more in 0.20.0, and these needed a decision: scalable viewport,
   stripping positive tabindex, stripping redundant `title`, the empty-search
   message, and naming fields from their placeholder. A server pass cannot
   reach any of them — they correct markup the theme already printed — so they
   run in the browser from `assets/front/site-fixes.js`, marked by the
   `RunsInBrowser` interface so the decision is auditable. **Read that
   interface's docblock before adding a sixth.** It adds no widget, no
   controls and no interface of any kind, which is what keeps it on the right
   side of rule 2, and every such fix must say in its caveat that it does
   nothing with JavaScript off.

   Constraints for anything added here: no writing to user content, no output
   buffering (SPEC F6), and every fix states what it might disturb — a test
   enforces the last one. Nothing may invent content: `label-form-fields`
   promotes a placeholder the author wrote and refuses to manufacture a name
   from an `id`, because a plausible label is worse than a missing one — it
   closes the finding and leaves the reader no better off.
3. **Free-tier features the competitor charges for**: full-site report screen,
   admin columns, dismissal log, CSV export.

   **Post types are posts and pages only**, decided in 0.29.0 and held in
   `src/Support/ScannableTypes.php`, which is the single list every gate reads.
   Walking every public post type had put a page builder's template library in
   the content picker beside Posts and Pages; a template and a pattern have no
   URL, so half the checks mean nothing about them, and a pattern's faults are
   found anyway on the pages it is inserted into. Custom types are excluded
   because nothing on the post type object says whether one is a document or a
   box of settings.

   This narrows scope, not access — nothing is gated and nothing is sold.
   `wsak_post_types` widens it in one line, and is a filter rather than a
   setting because choosing correctly needs knowledge of what a given post type
   is for.
4. **Monitoring is not part of the free plugin.** It was built free in 0.21.0
   and removed in 0.22.0 — the whole feature belongs to the paid add-on: the
   schedule, the per-page comparison, the change report, and the alerting that
   was always going to be paid.

   The tag `monitoring-for-pro-0.21.0` holds the working implementation, which
   was verified end to end before removal. `src/Monitoring/` was self-contained
   apart from `ScanRepository::history_for_post()`, which went with it. The
   scan-runner seam it drove — `BulkScan::start()` and `wsak_bulk_scan_finished`
   — is still here and still free, so the add-on has something to attach to.

   Do not rebuild any of it here, and do not reintroduce the word "monitor".
5. **Per-issue documentation** is what remains of this item. WP-CLI shipped in
   0.24.0 (`src/Cli/`, with `--all` on the scan command and a test that keeps it
   there); readability and the plain-language summary shipped in 0.25.0
   (`src/Readability/`).
6. **Page-builder compatibility.** Elementor was tested against a real page in
   0.27.0 and was broken: it keeps nothing in `post_content`, so the content
   fallback saw zero bytes and scanned every page as empty. `PageSource` now
   asks the builder, with `wsak_builder_content` as the seam for the rest.

   Divi and WP Bakery keep shortcodes in `post_content` and need nothing. Still
   untested against a real install: Oxygen and Beaver Builder (both store
   outside `post_content`, so both are suspect), Avada, ACF and WooCommerce.
   **Test by building a page and scanning it** — reading the plugin's
   documentation would not have found the Elementor fault.
7. **Done: WordPress.org.** Approved 2026-09-22. Three review rounds got it
   there, and each one is worth knowing because each was a class of fault
   rather than a line:

   - The name, "Accessibility Kit", was too close to other plugins. Renamed,
     and the slug is permanent now.
   - Two inline `<style>` elements had to be enqueued, and the redirect the
     onboarding fired on activation had to go — Guideline 11, hijacking the
     admin. The setup itself stayed; the dashboard opens on it instead.
   - The readme had to name the public repository the compiled JavaScript is
     built from, and document the build.
   - Two read endpoints asked for `RUN_SCAN` instead of `VIEW_REPORTS`, and
     findings were reported for pages the reader may not open. Both fixed, and
     `RestPermissionTest` now names the capability every gate must require —
     the check it replaced counted callbacks and passed while two were wrong.

   The lesson worth carrying: they say plainly that they may not list every
   instance of a fault. Every round here had a second instance they had not
   named. Search for the class, never patch the line.

All four extension seams exist, and `ExtensionSeamsTest` guards them — a renamed
filter is a silent break for every add-on at once, with no error anywhere:

- **Scan runner** — `BulkScan::start()` and `wsak_bulk_scan_finished`, which the
  paid monitor drives.
- **Fix pipeline** — `wsak_site_fixes`.
- **Report** — `wsak_report_data` and `wsak_report_formats`. The free plugin
  registers no format, so it shows no export control rather than a locked one.
- **Dismissal** — `wsak_can_dismiss`. It narrows only: the capability check runs
  first and is combined with `&&`, so no filter can grant rights over content
  somebody may not edit.

## Quality floor (every PR)
- Security: verify nonce + `current_user_can()` on every write/REST route;
  sanitize input, escape output, `$wpdb->prepare()` for all SQL.
- i18n: all user-facing strings translatable with the text domain.
- Accessible admin UI: WCAG 2.2 AA, full keyboard operability, visible focus,
  `prefers-reduced-motion` respected, semantic markup.
- Performance: heavy work through Action Scheduler.
- `bin/gate.sh` must pass — 10 steps, all of them.

## Branches
Work lands on **`Dev`**, then **`main`**, and reaches **`Release`** only once the
gate is green and anything worth checking live has been checked. A published
release is then tagged `vx.y.z` and pushed to SVN; `docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`
has the procedure, including the `Stable tag` / `tags/` pairing that is the
whole download mechanism and the easiest thing to break. `Website` is
separate and nothing here touches it. `main` is the default branch.

Three tags carry everything from the abandoned paid direction, because no branch
holds it any more: `pro-seed-0.15.1` (the last tree with the licensing SDK and AI intact),
`pro-plan-0.15.1` (`PRO-NOTES.md` and the renamed Pro bootstrap), and
`monitoring-for-pro-0.21.0` (monitoring, working and verified before removal).

## Commands
```bash
composer install        # PHP autoload + PHPCS
npm install             # wp-scripts + React
npm run start           # watch/build admin app  (npm run build for release)
npx wp-env start        # local WordPress → http://localhost:8888
bash bin/gate.sh        # the 10-step quality gate — run before every commit
```
The host PHP is 8.5 and cannot run the suite; `gate.sh` uses a `php:8.1-cli`
container for the PHP steps.
