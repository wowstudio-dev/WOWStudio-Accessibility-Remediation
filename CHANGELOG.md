# Changelog

All notable changes to WOWStudio Accessibility Remediation are documented here.
This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Scan summaries now record findings per rule, in `by_rule`, alongside the
  counts by severity and detection that were already there. The summary is the
  only part of a scan that outlives it — individual findings are pruned once a
  newer scan supersedes them — so without this, a scan more than one run old has
  nothing left to say about *what* it was failing, only how much. Anything
  comparing a page against its own past had to treat every rule in the newer
  scan as newly broken, which made every page look like it had got worse. Found
  by running the paid add-on's scheduled scan against a real install.

### Still outstanding

Rewritten at 1.0.0, because the previous version of this list had gone stale in
both directions: it asked for WP-CLI, which shipped in 0.24.0, and it counted
seventeen checks when there are forty. A list of what is missing is only worth
keeping if it is true.

- **Testing with disabled users, and a real screen-reader pass over the admin.**
  The contrast guard measures 91 colour pairings on every push and the interface
  is built to WCAG 2.2 AA, neither of which is the same thing as somebody using
  it. This is the largest gap and the one no amount of tooling closes.
- **Three checks that need work the current passes cannot do**: text too small
  to read, which is a computed size rather than a declared one; carousels; and
  animated GIFs, which means reading frame counts out of the file rather than
  guessing from the extension.
- **Page builders beyond Elementor.** Oxygen and Beaver Builder both store
  content outside `post_content` and are therefore suspect in the same way
  Elementor was before 0.27.0. Avada, ACF and WooCommerce are untested. The way
  to find out is to build a page and scan it.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-20

The third WordPress.org review round. One finding, with two halves, and both
were real.

### Security

- **Reading the findings report asked for the wrong capability.** Two
  controllers gated reading on RUN_SCAN, which is the capability for starting a
  scan, rather than VIEW_REPORTS. Every other read gate in the plugin — the
  dismissal log, the site fixes, the statement, the scan results — asks for
  VIEW_REPORTS; these two had drifted.

  Nothing misbehaved, because the roles this plugin grants hold both
  capabilities, and that is exactly why it survived. It stops being harmless the
  moment a site uses `wsak_role_capabilities` to let somebody run a scan without
  handing them the whole report, which is the distinction the two capabilities
  exist to draw. Both now refuse with a message instead of a bare 401.

  The review named one. The other was the same fault in the same shape, and
  their email says plainly that they may not list every instance.

- **Findings were reported for pages the reader may not be allowed to open.**
  Scans only ever run on published posts and pages, so this is about what
  happens afterwards: a page that was public when it was scanned and has since
  been made private or pulled back to a draft still has findings on file, and
  those carry its title and a fragment of its markup.

  The review found it on `/issues/grouped`, whose page names came from a query
  that read the issues table alone with no join to posts at all. It was equally
  true of the findings list and the dismissal log. All three are restricted now,
  in SQL rather than after the fact, so counts and pagination stay honest.

  Somebody who may read private content still sees findings on private pages,
  which is the point: the restriction has to narrow for the people it is about
  and nobody else.

### Added

- **A test that reads the capability behind every REST gate.** There was already
  one asserting that every route had a permission callback, and it passed
  throughout — counting the locks is not the same as checking they fit. The new
  one names all sixteen gates and the capability each must require, and it was
  confirmed to fail when the original fault is put back.

  It also corrects the older check, which compared callbacks against routes.
  One `register_rest_route()` can declare a readable and a creatable method, and
  each needs its own callback: thirty-three gates across twenty-nine routes is
  right, not a surplus.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-19

An audit before resubmitting, rather than a review round. Three real faults,
none of which the directory had flagged.

### Fixed

- **An opted-in uninstall left four of this plugin's own options behind.** The
  uninstaller deleted four options by name, and the plugin had grown eight: the
  site-wide fixes' settings, the simplified-summary switch, the cached theme
  profile and a legacy migration flag all survived. Each was added later than
  the uninstaller and nobody went back to it — a list of things to delete is a
  list somebody has to remember to extend, and nobody did, four times.

  Options are swept by prefix now. The paid add-on's `wsak_pro_` options are
  reserved from the sweep: uninstalling this plugin is not consent to delete
  the data of a different one that is still installed, and somebody removing
  the free plugin while keeping the add-on would otherwise lose its settings
  with no warning.

  Only visible from a real install. The four that leaked are written the first
  time somebody changes a setting or scans a theme, so a fresh install has
  nothing to leave behind and the existing tests asserted the four options that
  were named — which passed throughout.

- **A comment claimed the bulk-scan routes were a paid feature stripped from
  the free build.** Written in 0.14.0 for a two-tier product abandoned in
  0.16.0, and false for thirteen versions. Checking a whole site has always
  been free and the class is right there in the package. Left alone it invited
  exactly the question a reviewer should never have to ask about a plugin
  submitted as complete.

- **`LICENSE` still carried the old plugin name.** Missed by the 1.0.1 rename,
  which swept source and documentation but not the licence file.

### Notes

Verified on a database with the plugin's tables and options dropped, which is
the one path never exercised before: first activation creates all four tables,
seeds the settings with data retention off, grants the four capabilities, and
writes nothing to the debug log with `WP_DEBUG` on. Uninstall was run both ways
— data kept by default, removed on opt-in — and the add-on's table and options
survive both.

The suite also runs clean on PHP 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4, and all 255 shipped PHP
files parse on 8.4.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-18

The second WordPress.org review round. One finding.

### Added

- **The readme names the source repository, and says how to build it.** The
  plugin ships `build/` — webpack output, minified, including the statement
  block's bundle — and Guideline 4 requires either the source in the package or
  a documented public link to it. There was neither. The readme came close
  enough to make it worse: it said the history was "in CHANGELOG.md in the
  source repository" and named no repository, which is precisely what the
  review read as no plausible link.

  There is now a section giving the repository, mapping each compiled file back
  to the source it is generated from, and listing the commands that produce it.
  The guidelines only ask for directions as a recommendation; they cost four
  lines and they are the difference between a link somebody can audit and a
  link somebody has to reverse-engineer.

  It also says which JavaScript is *not* compiled. `assets/front/site-fixes.js`
  is the only script this plugin puts on the front end and it ships as written,
  which is worth stating rather than leaving a reviewer to check.

- `Source Code` in the plugin header. Not required — the guideline asks for the
  readme — but it is where a developer looks first.

### Changed

- The repository is now `WOWStudio-Accessibility-Remediation`, following the
  rename in 1.0.1. GitHub redirects the old path permanently, so the two
  changelog links that used it would still have resolved; they point at the new
  one anyway, because a link that only works by redirect is a link waiting to
  stop working.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-13

The first WordPress.org review round.

### Changed

- **The plugin is now WOWStudio Accessibility Remediation**, slug
  `wowstudio-accessibility-remediation`. The review flagged "Accessibility Kit"
  as too close to existing plugins in the directory, and they were right: it is
  a generic name in a crowded category, and it does not say the thing that makes
  this plugin different. Remediation does. The brief has described this as a
  real-remediation plugin from the start; the name now says so too.

  The text domain follows the slug, as it must, which is 919 strings across 196
  files. Nothing that touches data moved: the `wsak_` prefix, the `wp_wsak_*`
  tables and the `WOWStudio\AccessibilityKit` namespace are all unchanged, so
  there is no migration. The namespace keeps "AccessibilityKit" deliberately —
  it is internal, no reviewer reads it, and renaming it would be two hundred
  more files of churn for nothing.

- **The two inline `<style>` blocks are enqueued.** One printed the site-wide
  fixes' CSS into `wp_head`, the other the admin column's rules into
  `admin_head-edit.php`. Both now register a handle with no source and attach
  their rules with `wp_add_inline_style()`, which is what the guidelines ask for
  and which keeps the property that made them inline in the first place: a few
  hundred bytes, printed in a style element, no extra request. The front-end one
  moved to `wp_enqueue_scripts`, where it is still queued before the theme's own
  stylesheet and therefore still loses to it, which is the point.

### Removed

- **The redirect on activation.** It fired once, checked the capability and
  skipped bulk activations, and it was still the wrong thing: Guideline 11 asks
  plugins not to hijack the admin, and taking over whatever screen somebody was
  already on is the plainest reading of that however careful the safeguards
  were. The setup itself stays exactly as it was — the dashboard simply opens on
  it while it has not been done, which lands people in the same place without
  reaching outside the plugin's own screens.

  `Onboarding` registers no hooks at all now, and a test reads the file to keep
  it that way. A hook added back there would work perfectly and fail a review
  months later, with nothing failing in between to say so.

### Fixed

- **`Plugin URI` returned a 404.** It pointed at a page that does not exist.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-10

**First public release.**

Everything below shipped during development under version numbers nobody ever
installed — the plugin has never been on WordPress.org until now, so 1.0.0 is
the first version that exists as far as anybody outside this repository is
concerned. The entries are kept rather than collapsed because they are the
record of why the plugin is shaped the way it is, and several of them are the
reasoning behind decisions somebody will want to revisit.

The `@since` tags in the source are left at the versions the code was actually
written in, for the same reason.

Findings that keep their identity, and figures you can open.

### Removed

- **Every trace of the licensing SDK, including its name.** The vendor is no
  longer mentioned anywhere in the repository — not in the changelog, the
  security review, the spec, or the build tooling. `PROMPT.md`, a kickoff prompt
  for a two-tier product that was never built, is deleted outright.

  This is a rewrite of the record rather than an addition to it, done knowingly:
  the plugin has no users, the versions those entries describe were never
  installed by anybody, and carrying a payments vendor's name through the
  history of a plugin that takes no payments serves nobody. Where an entry
  documented a real change it still does, worded without the vendor.

- Dead exclusion entries in
  `phpcs.xml.dist`, `eslint.config.cjs` and `bin/check-claims.php` that named a
  directory which no longer existed, a PHPStan comment describing a scan path it
  did not describe, a CI comment claiming an exclusion that had already been
  dropped, and the two `SPEC.md` sections specifying how to wire and gate it.

  `pro-seed-0.15.1` still holds the code itself.

### Added

- **The same markup, decided once.** A theme prints its social icons into every
  footer, so the same fault arrives once per page and asks to be judged once per
  page. After the fortieth identical decision people stop reading findings and
  start clearing them, which is the point at which the list has taught somebody
  to ignore it — and the finding that mattered is the one they clear on
  autopilot afterwards.

  A rule-scoped list can now be grouped by the markup behind it, with one
  decision covering every instance. On the development site nine "clickable
  target is too small" findings collapse to two groups; seventeen skipped
  headings stay seventeen, because they are genuinely seventeen different
  problems.

  This is more careful than the per-page dismissal rather than less, because it
  retires findings on pages nobody has opened. The reason is required with no
  path around it, the pages it reaches are listed by name before it is taken,
  it needs the right to edit other people's content, a page that made its own
  call about the finding keeps it, and it can be withdrawn in one step from the
  decision log. A judgement that cannot be undone is not one worth offering.

- **Every figure on the report is now a door.** "What comes up most" and "Pages
  with the most to do" were counts and nothing else: the report said forty-five
  pieces of text had too little contrast and offered no way to see one of them.
  Both lists now open onto the findings behind them.

  The check's own explanation leads the filtered list — what the fault is, who
  it shuts out, and what to do about it, stated once at the top rather than
  repeated against all forty-five rows. When a list is already one check, the
  rows drop everything the brief has just said and keep only what differs: which
  markup this one is about, and where.

  All of it is free. Being told a barrier exists and not being shown where it is
  helps nobody, least of all the person who meets the barrier.

- `GET /wsak/v1/issues`, filterable by check, page, severity, detection and
  status, returning the findings, the total, and the rule's own description.
  `GET /wsak/v1/issues/grouped` returns the same findings collapsed to distinct
  markup, and `wsak_can_dismiss_site_wide` narrows who may decide that widely.

### Fixed

- **The score no longer contradicts the list underneath it.** The page checks
  run in the browser after the server pass has finished, and the endpoint that
  stored their findings returned the findings without the recomputed score or
  counts. So a page whose content-only scan found nothing showed "100 / 100 —
  0 issues detected automatically, 0 items still need a person to check"
  directly above a list of contrast failures. Both halves were honestly computed
  and each was about a different pass, which is not a distinction anybody should
  have to infer from a screen disagreeing with itself.

- **Style fixes are now weighted to win, instead of being written and losing.**
  A proposed rule used the element's tag and one class — `span.first-title` —
  which is one class and one element of specificity. On a page built with
  Essential Blocks the heading was already styled by
  `.eb-advance-heading-wrapper.eb-advance-heading-yj6uz .eb-ah-title
  .first-title`: four classes. Our rule was written, valid, matching, and
  outranked, so the page did not change.

  The proposal now reads what already styles the element, and repeats the
  anchoring class until it outranks it. Repeating the class rather than reaching
  for an ancestor chain is deliberate: it cannot change which elements are
  matched, and a chain of builder-generated wrappers breaks on the next save.

  Where the incumbent rule is `!important`, no stylesheet rule can win, and the
  proposal says so before it is applied rather than after.

- **Everything WordPress.org asks for.** The plugin passes Plugin Check with
  nothing reported in shipped code, and the directory assets exist: an icon at
  128 and 256, a banner at 772x250 and 1544x500, and seven screenshots of the
  real screens.

  Both generators are checked in rather than the output alone. The icon and
  banner are drawn from the palette in `style.scss` and the exact zigzag the
  admin header draws, so they cannot drift from the interface they advertise;
  the screenshots are taken from a running site in a fixed order that matches
  the readme's captions, because WordPress.org numbers those files and reads
  the captions positionally.

  They live in `.wordpress-org/` and `.distignore` keeps them out of the zip —
  WordPress.org reads them from the SVN `assets/` directory beside the plugin
  folder, and shipping a megabyte of banner art to every install would be a
  megabyte for nothing.

  Three code changes came out of the check itself. The setup's query argument is
  unslashed and sanitised before it is read. The overview's grouped counts are
  four whole queries rather than one with a column name interpolated into it —
  the allowlist guarding that was correct and the comment explaining it was
  true, but both needed reading, and now there is no assembled column name to
  verify. And the queries built from fixed placeholder fragments say so to
  Plugin Check's own sniff as well as to PHPCS; that checker cannot see through
  any variable, so restructuring to satisfy it produced worse code and the
  existing explanations were extended to cover it instead.

- **The Accessibility column said "Not checked" on every row, including pages
  with nineteen completed scans behind them.** Reported from a Pages screen
  where nothing had a score.

  The column fetches every scan the screen needs in one query, primed from
  `the_posts` — once, on the assumption that the first query to fire it is the
  list table's. On a block theme it is not. The Pages screen runs a
  `wp_global_styles` query first, so the single lookup the class allowed itself
  was spent on one post nobody was going to render, came back empty, and empty
  was stored. The guard that stopped it running twice then read that as
  "already primed" and turned the real query away. Every row after it printed
  "Not checked".

  Two changes. Only posts of the types this plugin scans are looked up, so a
  query for something that is not a page cannot consume the lookup. And what is
  remembered is which ids have been asked about, rather than whether anything
  was asked at all — "we asked and there was nothing" and "we never asked" were
  the same state, which is what made an empty result indistinguishable from an
  unprimed one. A row the batch never saw is now looked up on its own rather
  than reported as unchecked, because "Not checked" has to be a fact about the
  page rather than about our own bookkeeping.

  Still one query for the whole screen in the normal case.

- **A false positive can be put back.** The control existed and was in the one
  place it was no use: the card you dismiss offers "not a false positive after
  all" straight away, but that card is on the findings list, and the finding
  leaves that list the moment the decision is taken. Close the screen or scan
  the page again and the only place it still appeared was the False positives
  log, which had no way to undo anything. So the way back was available for
  about as long as it took to change your mind immediately, and not afterwards.

  Every row in that log now offers it, and each row says whether this account
  may take it — reopening asks for the fix capability and then for the right to
  edit the page the finding is on, which is not the same answer for every row,
  and one flag for the whole screen would have put a control on rows where it
  would fail.

  It withdraws the stored decision rather than flipping a row, so it holds
  across future scans. A reopen that only changed the row would have lasted
  until the next scan and then quietly put the finding back in the log.

  Withdrawing one now also says so out loud. The row leaves the screen when it
  succeeds, which is the point and also meant there was nothing left to report
  the outcome to anybody not watching the list get shorter — true of the
  site-wide withdrawals too, and fixed for both.

- **Scanning covers posts and pages, and nothing else.** It used to walk every
  public post type, which brought in things that are not pages at all: a page
  builder's template library registers itself public, so Elementor's appeared in
  the content picker as "My Templates", beside Posts and Pages, as though it
  were somewhere a visitor could go.

  A template and a pattern have no URL. There is nothing to render in the
  browser pass, and roughly half the checks only mean anything about a whole
  document — a heading-order fault reported against a fragment that appears
  inside twenty pages says nothing about any of them. A pattern is worse: the
  same pattern is inserted into content that gets scanned properly, so its
  faults are already found where they actually occur, attached to a page
  somebody can open. Scanning the source as well doubles every finding. And
  nothing on a custom post type says whether it holds a document or a box of
  settings, so the safe default is the two types WordPress guarantees are
  pages.

  One list, in `src/Support/ScannableTypes.php`, read by every gate: the two
  pickers, both scan routes, the admin column, the theme profile, the coverage
  figure and the WP-CLI command. A test names each of them, because the failure
  is silent in both directions. The routes enforce it rather than the interface
  — post ids arrive in a request body, not from the picker that offered them —
  and `wp wsak scan` refuses an unsupported `--post-type` outright rather than
  filtering it out, since an unknown post type matches nothing and a typo would
  otherwise report "nothing to check" on a site full of content.

  This narrows what the plugin claims to cover; it gates nothing. A site that
  knows a custom type is a real page says so with `wsak_post_types`, in one
  line, and every screen and route follows.

  The site-wide coverage figure changes as a result: the denominator now counts
  only content a scan can reach, so "8 of 40 scanned" no longer measures the
  site against a target it cannot meet.

- **A setup, on the first run.** Activating the plugin now opens a three-step
  screen instead of dropping somebody on an empty report. Nothing here scans on
  its own, so a fresh install's honest state is "no data yet" — and a dashboard
  of zeroes says "broken" far more loudly than it says "waiting".

  The first step is what the plugin is and, more usefully, what it will not
  claim on anybody's behalf: nothing leaves the site, nothing is added to the
  front of it, and it will not tell you the law is settled. The second and third
  are the site-wide fixes and the first scan, and both render the real screen
  rather than a summary of it — a wizard that paraphrases the settings it is
  setting is two copies of the same text that will disagree within a release,
  and on the fixes screen the text being paraphrased away would be the caveat
  under each switch, which is exactly what somebody needs in front of them at
  the moment they flip it.

  Every step is optional and nothing is switched on for anybody. Leaving halfway
  is a supported outcome rather than an abandoned funnel.

  It is a view on the dashboard page rather than a page of its own, which is
  WordPress's decision rather than a preference: a page with no menu entry has
  to be registered and then removed from the menu, and
  `user_can_access_admin_page()` resolves a page's parent by walking the menu it
  was just taken out of — so it looks the page up under an empty parent, misses
  it, and refuses access. The page exists and nobody may open it.

- **Layout faults introduced by going full width, found by sweeping every
  screen rather than by looking at them.** The theme findings had lost their
  padding entirely and sat against their own border: they render the same card
  as the findings list, and when that card gave its padding to the accordion
  inside it, the one without an accordion had none left. Only the collapsible
  kind gives it up now.

  Four blocks of prose had no line-length cap and had been fine only because
  the plugin used to be 1240px wide: the help text under every WordPress
  control, at nearly two hundred characters a line; the sentence qualifying the
  score; the note under the trend; and the accessibility statement preview,
  which is the document somebody is about to publish and should be previewed
  the way it will be read.

  And the preview frame was two pixels wider than the pane holding it — an
  iframe does not inherit the admin's border-box.

- **The dashboard cards had a box and no padding, so every label in them sat
  hard against an edge.** Flattening those cards zeroed their padding, border,
  radius and background so the charts inside would carry the colour on their
  own. The shadow did not go with them, and a shadow on its own is still a
  container — it draws a hairline box on all four sides. They are panels again,
  matching every other panel in the plugin.

  A second sweep found it. The first one checked each element against its
  parent's box and each block of prose against its line length, which is why it
  missed this: nothing here overflowed anything, and the container drawing the
  box had no border and no background for the audit to notice. The check now
  asks whether an element draws an enclosing box at all — border, background or
  shadow — and then whether anything inside it reaches the edge.

- **A paragraph of English was being typeset as a code snippet.** Where a theme
  finding had no general correction to hand over, the panel fell back to the
  rule's description and set it in the dark monospaced block kept for markup,
  under a line telling the reader to send the change below to their developer.
  It was not a change: it was the explanation from further up the same card,
  reworded. On a real finding it came out as one unwrapped line two thousand
  pixels wide. The text is worth showing and now reads as the prose it is, and
  the sentence above it no longer points at a snippet that is not there.

- **Chart labels wrapped instead of truncated.** The names of the checks are
  sentences, and an ellipsis landed mid-sentence on most of them — "Clickable
  target is smaller t…" does not say smaller than what, which is the whole
  content of the row. The bars already carried a full summary for a screen
  reader, so it was only the sighted reader who was not getting the name.

- **The report is figures on a page rather than figures in boxes.** Four
  bordered cards holding one number each spent most of their pixels drawing
  containers, and the containers said nothing the whitespace was not already
  saying. The charts lost their borders too; their headings are small-caps
  labels above what they name.

  The score's qualifier moved from under the number to beside it — they are one
  thought, and what a score does not mean has to travel with it. The four
  figures take the full width underneath. The scan-by-scan line left the
  three-column grid: thirty points squeezed into a third of the page is a shape
  nobody can read, which is the only thing a sequence of scores is for.

- **The plugin is four admin pages instead of one page wearing eight tabs.**
  Dashboard, Scan & Fix, Settings and Statement now appear under Accessibility
  Kit in the WordPress menu. The Dashboard is the report. Scan & Fix holds the
  ways of checking and answering content — one page, your content, the theme,
  the images — and the record of what was marked a false positive, which belongs
  beside the findings it came from. The site-wide fixes are Settings; the
  statement is its own page.

  The previous attempt grouped the eight tabs under Find, Fix and Record
  headings. That put a taxonomy on screen and asked people to read it before
  they could find anything, when WordPress already has a place for a plugin's
  shape and everyone already knows where to look for it.

  A screen with a single view shows no tab row at all: one tab is a label
  dressed as a choice, and it makes people hunt for the others.

- **The header says when anything was last checked, on every screen.** Nothing
  here scans on its own, so every figure on screen is only as old as the last
  time somebody pressed the button, and "nothing checked yet" is a normal answer
  the report alone never gave. Beside it is a control that opens the screen
  where you choose what to check — deliberately not one that starts a site-wide
  run, because that is not something to set going by accident.

- **A real first screen.** A new install opened on an empty report, which reads
  as a plugin that does not work rather than one waiting to be told what to
  check; testers landed there first and could not tell which it was. It now says
  what to do, offers the two ways of doing it, and sets out Find → Fix → Say so
  before anybody has committed to anything.

- **The findings list opens one finding at a time.** Every card used to render
  everything it had — the consequence, the fix plan, the markup, the page, the
  path, the dismiss control — for all fifty findings at once. Testers called it
  a wall, and they were describing something real: the one line that differed
  between two cards was buried under a screenful of identical scaffolding, so
  fifty findings read as one finding printed fifty times.

  A closed finding is now a single row — what is wrong, and where — at 60px
  against the 417px an open one takes. Up and down move between them without
  opening anything, Home and End go to the ends, and the row that is open stays
  open while you work on it.

- **A finding now says where it is in words you can act on.** The only location
  on a card was the DOM path — things like
  `/html/body/main/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[1]/div/h3/span`.
  That is precisely right for the code that has to find the element again in a
  preview frame, and no use at all to the person reading the report: it
  describes a tree they cannot see, in a notation most people who write for the
  web have never met, and it cannot tell them whether the finding is about their
  headline or their cookie banner.

  Findings now lead with the element and its words —
  `span.first-title — “About the Conference”`, `img — “team-photo.jpg”` — and
  the path moves one disclosure down for whoever wants it.

  Derived from the markup already stored with each finding rather than computed
  during a scan, so the two passes cannot disagree about it and findings
  recorded before this existed get one without being rescanned.

- **Every finding now says what happens next.** A card gave a severity and a
  detection tag — "Serious", "Auto-detected" — and left the reader to work out
  from two pieces of jargon whether the plugin was going to do something,
  whether they had to, or whether it was even a real problem. Both describe the
  finding; neither describes what the person reading is meant to do about it,
  which is the only question they opened the list with.

  Four states, one per finding, in words: **We can fix this**, **You fix this**,
  **Your theme needs this**, **Someone needs to check this** — each with a
  sentence saying how, shown rather than collapsed behind a disclosure. All of
  it was already on the finding and none of it had been put into a sentence.

- **"Set aside" is now "False positives".** The old wording asked people to
  learn a phrase this plugin invented for something the industry already names.
  "This is not a problem" becomes "Add to false positives".

- **The admin screens use the full window.** They were capped at 1240px, which
  suited prose and squeezed the tables, code and side-by-side panels these
  screens are mostly made of. Line length is now held on the blocks of prose
  that need it rather than by narrowing everything.

- **Every finding in a rule-scoped list says which page it is on**, and links
  to it. A list narrowed to one check gathers findings from the whole site, so a
  row that gave the message, the markup and an XPath was handing somebody a path
  and no page to apply it to. Not shown on a single page's own scan, where the
  heading has already said it once and fifty repeats would say it fifty times.

- **The headline no longer counts "I could not check this" as a finding.**
  Every finding is tagged auto-detected or needs-manual-review, and the number
  people actually read added the two together — quietly undoing the tagging on
  the one figure that gets screenshotted. The development site reported 387 open
  findings, of which 153 were barriers we had settled and 234 were questions we
  could not answer. Two figures now: **Barriers found** and **Needs a person to
  look**.

- **Contrast that cannot be measured is reported once per background, not once
  per word.** A hero section with a photograph behind it defeats the measurement
  for every piece of text inside it, and one finding per text node turned a
  single unanswerable question into 213 of them — burying the 71 contrast
  failures that had been measured. The finding is now attributed to the element
  carrying the background and says how much text it covers.

- **Text nobody can see is no longer a contrast failure.** Fully transparent
  text was composited over its own backdrop, which by definition produces the
  backdrop colour and a ratio of exactly 1.00:1 — so every carousel dot styled
  `color: transparent` was reported as the worst contrast failure possible.

- **A finding can no longer contradict itself in its own sentence.** A control
  23.98px tall was reported as "24.0 pixels, so it is not quite 24 tall
  enough". The verdict was right and the number was rounded to nearest;
  measurements now round down, so a near miss reads as one. A test for exactly
  this already existed and could not fail, because its fixture used 23.6 —
  which renders as "23.6" whichever way it is rounded.

  Together these took the development site from 387 open findings to 128, and
  contrast from 293 to 50. Nothing was hidden: the unmeasurable text is still
  reported, counted, and named.

- **The overview's top row no longer has a hole in it.** The score card and the
  four figures beside it sat in a grid aligned to the start, so a 365px card
  stood next to a 139px row and left two hundred pixels of nothing underneath.
  The figures are now two by two and fill the height the score sets.

- **Three things that should never have been in the plugin package**:
  `eslint.config.cjs`, `webpack.config.js`, `.DS_Store` and the `.claude`
  directory were all being copied into the zip. Found by the build guard below
  rather than by looking, which is the point of it.

- **The licensing SDK's directory stopped shipping.** The SDK went in 0.16.0,
  but its directory did not: one leftover dashboard icon stayed behind,
  `.distignore` never listed it, and `bin/build.sh` copies everything that file
  does not exclude. Every zip built since — including the one produced today —
  has carried that folder inside a plugin whose own readme promises no licensing
  SDK and no outbound requests.

  Nothing executed and nothing phoned home; it was one PNG. It was still a
  claim contradicted by the package it shipped in, which is the kind of thing
  a WordPress.org reviewer is right to ask about.

  The directory is gone, and `bin/build.sh` now checks what ships against an
  allowlist rather than trusting `.distignore` to have named everything it
  should exclude. A blocklist only stops what somebody remembered to write down,
  and the thing nobody remembers to write down is the thing that ships.

- **Findings stored before this version are given their identity in the
  background**, in batches through Action Scheduler rather than by holding an
  admin request open while a large site's table is rewritten. Without it a
  rescan of every page would be the only way to make decisions carry, and the
  grouped view would be empty until somebody did it.

  Rows still waiting are excluded from grouping and counted out loud, never
  guessed at: grouping them on their empty identity would have collected
  forty-five unrelated contrast failures into one group whose "set aside
  everywhere" retired all of them at once.

### Fixed

- **Dismissals no longer disappear when a page is rescanned.** A finding set
  aside, and the reason given for it, were stored on the issue row the scan
  happened to be holding. The next scan inserted a fresh row with status open
  and consulted nothing, so the judgement was discarded — silently, with the
  only symptom being a finding quietly reappearing weeks later.

  Judgements now live in their own table, keyed on the finding rather than on
  the row. The issue row still carries a copy, which is what lets every existing
  query keep reading `status` off the row without knowing decisions exist; the
  table is the record, the column is what the last scan happens to be holding.

  This mattered more than a lost checkbox. The dismissal note is what a
  conformance document is eventually built from, and it was the part being
  thrown away.

- **Site-wide counts no longer include superseded findings.** Nothing ever
  removed an earlier scan's issues, so a page scanned sixteen times contributed
  sixteen copies of each of its faults and the totals grew the more diligently
  somebody used the plugin. On the development site this read 1,037 open
  findings where there were 123.

  The sharp edge was that the score was already right — it joins to the newest
  scan per page — so the one honest number on the overview sat beside a set of
  counts computed a different way and disagreeing with it. A scan now retires
  the findings of the previous scan of the same thing.

### Added

- `Scanner\Fingerprint`, the stable identity a finding carries: the rule plus
  its markup, whitespace-normalised. Keyed on markup rather than the XPath
  selector, because a selector shifts the moment somebody adds a paragraph above
  the element — exactly when a person is most likely to rescan and least likely
  to notice their earlier judgement has vanished.

  Normalisation is whitespace collapse and nothing more. Stripping attributes
  would group "similar" markup and let one decision retire a finding about a
  photograph nobody had looked at, which does not produce a tidier list, it
  produces a page that reports itself reviewed when it was not.

- `Db\DecisionRepository` and the `wp_wsak_decisions` table. Decisions are
  scoped to a page, or to the whole site with `post_id` 0 — the seam the
  decide-once flow will attach to. A page's own decision outranks the site-wide
  one, so putting a single instance back cannot unpick a judgement taken about
  two hundred others.

### Upgrading

Existing dismissals are copied into the decisions table **before** superseded
findings are cleared out. The order is load-bearing and is enforced in
`Installer::migrate_decisions()`: reversing it would destroy the one thing in
that table which cannot be regenerated by scanning again.

Open counts will drop after upgrading. Nothing has been hidden — the earlier
figures were counting the same findings several times over.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-09-06

The first-run cliff, and a door to the coverage panel.

### Added

- **A "what to do next" panel** on the overview, computed from the site rather
  than written in advance. Nothing scanned yet, so check a page. Everything
  scanned but fourteen fixes switched off, so look at those. Fixes on but a
  hundred images undescribed, so open the Images screen. Nothing outstanding, so
  say nothing.

  Three rules keep it from becoming the thing everybody hates. **One step, never
  a checklist** — a list with ticks turns a tool into homework and its
  unfinished items accuse somebody for months. **It goes quiet**: with nothing
  worth suggesting it renders nothing, because a panel that always has something
  to say is furniture within a week and then ignored on the day it matters. And
  **it never invents urgency** — each step says what is available, not what is
  wrong. The plugin already reports what is wrong; it does not also need to nag
  about its own features.

  Silence has its own tests, and it is silence rather than congratulation: a
  clean automated scan means the checks passed, which is a much smaller
  statement than the site being usable, and the empty dashboard is the last
  place that should blur the two.

- **A door to the coverage panel**, from the overview and from the foot of the
  findings list. It documented all forty-one checks and rendered only after a
  single-page scan, which meant nobody found it. It is a view rather than a new
  tab: reference material people want twice — once starting out and once when a
  finding surprises them — and a permanent tab for that is a tab everybody
  scrolls past. The door at the foot of the findings is deliberate; somebody who
  has just read a list of problems is the person most likely to want to know
  what was *not* looked for.

### Notes

- `NextStep` takes two callables rather than the objects behind them, and calls
  them only when the answer is needed. Counting undescribed images is a database
  query, and on a site whose first suggestion is "check a page" nobody should pay
  for it on the most-loaded screen in the plugin. It also means a test can say
  "pretend six fixes are off" without `SiteFixManager` or `MediaIndex` giving up
  being final — what this class depends on is two integers, and the signature now
  says so.
- `wsak_next_step` filters the suggestion, and returning null shows nothing.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-09-06

Page-builder content, and a statement anybody can read.

### Fixed

- **Elementor pages scanned against a search-engine stub.** Caught on a real
  Elementor page after the first fix looked like it worked. Elementor writes a
  stripped text copy of the page into `post_content` — on that page, 3,808 bytes
  of bare headings against 69,503 bytes of actual page. The first fix only asked
  the builder when `post_content` rendered to *nothing*, so it never fired, and
  the scan read the stub and reported a confident hundred out of a hundred.

  A false clean bill of health is the worst thing this plugin can produce.
  Everything else it does is hedged precisely so nobody reads more into a result
  than it can carry, and a confident 100 on a page nobody has really looked at
  undoes all of it. The builder is now asked **first**: where one owns the page,
  its output *is* the page, and `post_content` is a search engine's copy rather
  than a second opinion.

- **Elementor pages scanned as though they were empty.** Found by building a
  real Elementor page and looking, not by reading documentation. Elementor keeps
  nothing in `post_content` — a JSON tree in postmeta, rendered through hooks
  that only fire inside the loop on a real request — so applying `the_content`
  to the empty string it leaves behind returned the empty string. On any site
  where loopback is blocked, every Elementor page reached the parser with zero
  bytes. The rendered page was eighty kilobytes.

  The scan failed safe rather than reporting a false clean bill of health, which
  is the one thing that saves this from being much worse. But it failed with
  "the page could not be parsed as HTML", which is true in a narrow sense and
  useless: it named the symptom and neither of the two things the reader could
  act on.

  The content fallback now asks the builder when `post_content` renders to
  nothing. Elementor is handled directly, guarded on every hop — a class that
  may not exist, a property that may not be set, a method that may be renamed —
  because reaching into another plugin's internals unguarded is a fatal error on
  somebody's dashboard. Everything else goes through `wsak_builder_content`,
  which is the extension point rather than a list of builders this file has to
  keep up with.

  Divi and WP Bakery need none of this: both keep shortcodes in `post_content`,
  so `the_content` renders them correctly and always did.
- The "nothing to scan" error names both possible causes and asserts neither.
  From the server, a genuinely empty page and one rendered by something
  unreachable look identical, and claiming the second would be inventing a
  diagnosis.

### Changed

- **The accessibility statement is written more plainly.** Four long sentences
  became shorter ones; the guarded disclosure phrases are untouched. It now
  passes `reading-level-high`, so `DogfoodTest` has dropped the AAA exemption it
  briefly carried and is unconditional again — shortening four sentences was
  cheaper than the exemption, and a statement only a lawyer can read is a poor
  advertisement for a plugin about accessibility.
- That test now asserts through the rule rather than measuring separately, so
  what it checks is exactly the number a user would be shown.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-09-06

The last two extension seams, before the screens around them grow.

### Added

- `wsak_report_data` and `wsak_report_formats` on the whole-site report. The
  first lets an exporter take exactly what is on screen rather than
  reassembling it from the tables and drifting out of step with what somebody is
  looking at. The second is how an export control appears at all — the free
  plugin registers none, so it shows no button rather than a locked one.
- `wsak_can_dismiss`, so restrictions on who may set a finding aside can be
  added without `IssueReview` knowing what they are.

  It narrows and cannot widen. The capability check runs first and is combined
  with `&&`, so a filter returning true still cannot hand somebody the right to
  make decisions about content they may not edit. That check is WordPress's, and
  passing responsibility for it to a third party would make it possible for
  another plugin to open a door this one is answerable for.

All four seams now exist and `ExtensionSeamsTest` guards them: a renamed filter
is a silent break for every add-on at once, with no error anywhere.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-09-06

Reading level and the plain-language summary — WCAG 3.1.5, and the last thing
the established free competitor had that this did not. Forty-one checks.

### Added

- `reading-level-high`, estimating Flesch–Kincaid grade level and reporting when
  a page reads above lower secondary school.
- A **plain-language summary** field in the editor's Accessibility sidebar,
  stored as registered post meta so it appears in the REST API and travels with
  an export. Optionally rendered above the content; off by default.

### What this measures, and what it does not

The rule reports as *needs review* and could not honestly be anything else.
Flesch–Kincaid counts words per sentence and syllables per word and understands
nothing: it can be improved by chopping one clear sentence into three fragments,
which makes the writing worse. It has no idea who the audience is — a page for
cardiologists is allowed to read like one. So the finding says what was measured
and what it might mean, never that the page fails.

Three refusals, because a number in a box gets believed:

- **Under a hundred words, it says nothing.** A formula fed two sentences
  reports a grade as confidently as it reports one for an essay.
- **Not in English, it says nothing.** Both the syllable heuristic and the
  coefficients are English. Run over German it still returns a number, which is
  the danger: a number that means nothing looks exactly like one that does.
- **Over sixty words a sentence, it says nothing.** See below.

### Fixed before it shipped

The rule reported this plugin's own accessibility statement at **grade 23**.
The prose was not the problem: text was arriving with sentence punctuation
stripped, because the extraction took a whole element's text and ran headings,
navigation and list items together into one unpunctuated four-hundred-word run.
Flesch–Kincaid divides by whatever it is given and cannot notice.

Two changes came out of it. The rule now reads paragraphs only — a readability
formula is for prose, and averaging in menu labels measures the theme rather
than the writing — and terminates each one before appending the next. And the
formula refuses outright above sixty words per sentence, because no natural
English writing averages that and the input is punctuation-free rather than
difficult. The statement now measures grade 9.8.

### On our own statement

9.8 is above the 3.1.5 threshold of 9. `DogfoodTest` now excludes AAA criteria
from its pass/fail — the dogfooding rule is WCAG 2.2 **AA**, per CLAUDE.md rule
6 — but the exclusion is a named constant rather than a silent filter, and a
separate test asserts the statement stays under grade 12 so that an edit pushing
it towards fifteen is noticed. An accessibility statement only a lawyer can read
is a poor advertisement, and it is worth simplifying.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-09-06

A command line, with bulk in it.

### Added

- `wp wsak scan [<post-id>...] [--all] [--post-type=]` — checks pages and prints
  a table, or JSON, or CSV.
- `wp wsak issues [--post=] [--severity=] [--status=]` — the findings from each
  page's most recent check.
- `wp wsak checks` — all forty checks, with severity, success criterion and
  which pass runs them.
- `wp wsak fixes [<id>] [--on|--off]` — list the site-wide fixes, or switch one.

### Notes

- **Bulk is not held back from the command line.** The reason to have a CLI at
  all is continuous integration and staging audits, and a command that can only
  do one page at a time is useless for both — somebody reaching for WP-CLI is
  going to put it in a pipeline, and a tool that cannot go in a pipeline is a
  demonstration rather than a tool. A test asserts `--all` stays.
- Runs synchronously rather than through Action Scheduler. The queue exists so a
  browser request does not time out; a terminal has no such problem, and a
  command that returned immediately and told you to wait for a background job
  would be worse at the one thing it is for.
- Every scan row states its coverage — "full page" or "content only" — because a
  content-only scan covers less, and a score that does not say so invites being
  compared against one that means something different.
- An empty result says that automated checks cover part of WCAG rather than
  reporting a pass. The terminal gets the same honesty as the interface.
- `stubs/wp-cli.php` exists for static analysis only. WP-CLI is the environment
  the plugin may run inside, never a dependency, and the stub is excluded from
  the shipped build.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-09-06

Two things the obvious competitor charges for.

### Added

- **An accessibility column** on the Posts and Pages screens: the latest score
  and how many findings are open. The dashboard is where somebody goes once they
  have decided to think about accessibility; this is for the rest of the time,
  when they are already on the Pages screen for another reason.

  One query for the whole screen, not one per row — a column that queried per
  row would add twenty queries to a screen people load constantly and that this
  plugin is a guest on. "Not checked" is rendered as exactly that and never as a
  zero: a page nobody has scanned and a page with no findings are different
  statements, and conflating them would be our own version of the fault we
  report elsewhere. The colour band carries no words, because calling a page
  "good" on the strength of checks that cover part of WCAG is a verdict this
  plugin does not issue.
- **A "Set aside" screen** and `GET /wsak/v1/dismissed`: every finding somebody
  chose not to act on, with the reason they gave, their name and the date.

  Readable by anyone who can view reports, which is deliberately wider than the
  capability needed to dismiss. Setting a finding aside is a judgement rather
  than a fix — the barrier is still there — and a record of judgements that only
  their authors can read is not much of a record.

  It is a query, not a second store: the note, the user and the timestamp were
  already on the finding, so this cannot drift out of step with what it
  describes. Scoped to each page's most recent scan, so one decision is not
  listed five times over.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-09-06

Monitoring moves to the paid add-on, one release after it arrived.

### Removed

- **The whole monitoring feature**: `src/Monitoring/`, the REST routes, the
  screen, `ScanRepository::history_for_post()`, and the
  `wsak_accessibility_changed` seam. `monitoring-for-pro-0.21.0` tags the
  working implementation, verified end to end, for the add-on to be built from.
- **The word "monitor"**, from the plugin header, the readme, the README, the
  dashboard subtitle and the legal-scope note. Positioning is now *"helps you
  find, fix and document"*.

  That second removal is the point rather than tidying. A header advertising a
  feature the plugin does not have is the same species of claim
  `bin/check-claims.php` exists to stop — it simply is not on the word list.
  Whichever side of the line monitoring sits, the description has to match the
  code.

### Kept

- `BulkScan::start()` and `wsak_bulk_scan_finished`, the seam the monitor drove.
  Still free, so the add-on has something to attach to and so nothing else that
  wants to know when a run finished has to be rewritten later.

### Note on the decision

This reverses 0.21.0, and the reasoning on both sides is worth keeping because
the question will come back. The argument for free was that detecting a
regression is *finding*, and finding is never gated. The argument for paid, which
won, is that monitoring is the one feature whose value accrues monthly, which is
what a subscription is for — and that a free tier which already gives away
site-wide scanning, every check, admin columns and the full-site report does not
also need to give away the thing the paid version is meant to be.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-09-06

Monitoring. The plugin has advertised the word since 0.1.0 and has not, until
now, done it.

### Added

- **A schedule.** Weekly or monthly, off by default. Nothing more frequent is
  offered: a check that runs more often than the content changes produces a
  stream of "nothing happened" that people stop reading, which is how a
  monitoring feature fails in practice. Each run covers the fifty most recently
  updated pages, and the screen says so rather than implying whole-site coverage
  it does not have.
- **Comparison.** What appeared and what was resolved between a page's last two
  scans, computed from the scans themselves rather than written into a log of
  its own — a separate change table would eventually disagree with the data it
  claims to describe, and a history that contradicts its own scans is worse than
  no history.
- **A "What has changed" screen**, and `GET`/`POST /wsak/v1/monitoring`.
- **`wsak_accessibility_changed`**, the fourth extension seam: a run's
  regressions and every movement, for anything that wants to send them
  somewhere.

### The line, since this one needed deciding

All of it is free. Detecting that a page started failing something it used to
pass **is finding**, and finding is the thing this product does not gate —
telling somebody a barrier appeared on their site only after they pay puts the
cost on their disabled visitors, who did not choose the plan.

What a paid add-on may sell is being told *without looking*: email digests,
Slack, webhooks, custom frequencies, crawling beyond WordPress content. That is
delivery rather than detection, it carries real marginal cost, and it is what
people actually renew for — a scheduled scan you must log in to read is worth
much less than a message saying the pricing page dropped twelve points. The
free plugin sends nothing anywhere and still contacts no outside service.

### Notes

- Comparison counts per rule, not per finding. Findings have no stable identity
  across scans — the same missing alt on the same image is a new row each time,
  because a finding records where something was in one parse of one document.
  Per rule asks the question that can be answered: did this page start failing
  something it used to pass.
- `regressed` is a narrow, factual claim: findings that were not there before
  and are now. A score can move because a page got longer, so the score movement
  is never shown on its own — it sits beside what actually changed.
- The schedule is re-synced on every admin request, not only when saved. A
  scheduled action can vanish — a database restored from backup, Action
  Scheduler's tables rebuilt — and monitoring that quietly stopped monitoring is
  the worst way for this to fail.
- Contrast guard: 98 → 105 pairings.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-09-06

The five fixes a server pass cannot reach. The fix layer is complete at
fourteen.

### Added

- **`RunsInBrowser`**, a marker interface with no methods. It exists so the
  decision is visible: `implements RunsInBrowser` is the answer to "which of
  these run script on my visitors' pages?", and the docblock carries the whole
  reasoning rather than leaving it in a commit message.
- **Five fixes**: make the page zoomable, reset a positive tabindex to zero,
  remove a `title` that only repeats the visible text, promote a placeholder to
  a field's accessible name, and refuse an empty search with a message instead
  of a blank results page.
- `assets/front/site-fixes.js` — plain, unbundled, unminified, no dependencies.
  It runs on every visitor's page, so somebody who wants to know exactly what
  this plugin does to their front end should be able to read it without a source
  map. Nothing is enqueued at all unless one of these five is switched on.
- The settings screen now says which fixes need JavaScript, rather than leaving
  somebody to discover that one of them does nothing for part of their audience.

### Why these run in the browser

Everything else in this layer supplies something *missing* through a filter.
These five correct markup the theme has already printed, which no filter
reaches — the only server-side route would be to buffer the response and rewrite
it, and SPEC F6 rules that out because rewriting whatever HTML comes past is how
an overlay works.

It is not the overlay product rule 2 forbids, and the difference is not one of
degree. An overlay adds a widget — buttons, panels, font-size and contrast
controls — on top of a site that is still broken underneath. This adds no
interface of any kind: it renders nothing, has no controls, and a visitor cannot
tell it is there. It makes five named corrections to five named faults and
stops.

The rules it keeps: nothing is invented, no interface, narrow selectors, and it
degrades to nothing with JavaScript off — which every one of the five says in
its own caveat, because that is a real limitation and a different one from the
rest of the layer.

- **`label-form-fields` is the one that had to be held back.** It promotes
  wording the author already wrote in the placeholder, and refuses to
  manufacture a name from a field's `name` or `id`. That is where a fix of this
  kind usually goes wrong: it can always produce *something*, so a field ends up
  announced as "user_email_2", the finding disappears from the report, and the
  reader is no better off. A plausible label is worse than a missing one,
  because it stops anybody looking again. Fields with no placeholder keep their
  findings.

### Notes

- The viewport correction runs immediately rather than on `DOMContentLoaded`,
  and the script loads in the head for that reason: waiting would mean the first
  paint used the setting that blocks zooming, which is the one moment a reader
  who needs to zoom is most likely to try.
- `contrast guard` now covers 98 pairings, up from 91. Its list is maintained by
  hand and does not notice new colours on its own.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-06

The site-wide fix layer. Nine switches that supply what a theme leaves out, on
every page at once.

### Added

- **A fix registry and the `wsak_site_fixes` filter** — the third of the four
  extension seams the plugin is being built with, so a separate add-on can
  register a fix without this codebase knowing it exists.
- **Nine fixes**: a skip link and the target it jumps to; a visible focus
  outline; underlines on links in body text; the page language; the document
  title; names for the search and comment fields; "(opens in a new tab)" on
  content links that do; "(PDF, 1.2 MB)" on content links that download; and a
  policy switch that refuses PDF uploads from anyone but an administrator.
- `GET` and `POST /wsak/v1/site-fixes`, and a Site fixes screen. Changing a fix
  needs the settings capability rather than the fix capability: these change
  every page for every visitor, which is a different decision from correcting
  one finding on one post.

### Changed

- `Remediation\TitleTagFix` is retired and becomes the `page-title` site fix.
  Its option is carried across on upgrade, because a page that had a title
  yesterday and does not today would be a regression this plugin caused. Its
  two REST routes are gone; nothing ever called them.

### Notes on how these are built

Three constraints, all of them load-bearing:

- **Nothing is written to anybody's content.** Every fix is a filter or an
  action, so switching one off leaves the site exactly as it was. No stored
  markup, and nothing added to the site's own Additional CSS.
- **Nothing buffers the page.** SPEC decision F6 rules that out, and not for
  performance: rewriting whatever HTML comes past is how an overlay works, and
  it changes far more than it was asked to. The two content fixes filter
  `the_content` — a filter for post content, not for the page — and they insert
  without re-serialising, so every byte nobody asked us to touch comes back
  identical.
- **Every fix states what it might disturb.** A test asserts that none of them
  ships without a caveat.

### Fixed

- The inline stylesheet was escaped with `esc_html()`, which looks like the
  careful thing to do and is wrong: a `<style>` element is raw text, entities
  inside it are never decoded, so `p > a` was printed as `p &gt; a` and every
  rule using a child combinator silently stopped matching. The underline fix was
  a switch that turned on and did nothing. Caught by reading the printed output
  on a real page rather than trusting the unit test, which had asserted the CSS
  was *generated* and never that it survived being printed. Now guarded against
  the one sequence that can end a raw text element early, with a regression test
  that asserts the combinator survives.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-06

Eleven more checks. The scanner goes from 29 to 40 — 35 on the server, 5 in the
browser. That closes most of the detection gap against the established free
competitor, which ships 44.

### Added

- `input-image-alt-missing` — `<input type="image">` is a submit button with
  nowhere to put visible text, so `alt` is the only name it can have. Worse than
  an undescribed decorative image, because this one does something.
- `table-header-empty` — a header cell is what a screen reader announces before
  each value, so an empty one leaves a whole row or column unlabelled. The empty
  corner cell of a cross-tabulated table is skipped: every such table has one and
  it genuinely has nothing to say.
- `duplicate-id` — labels, ARIA references, in-page links and scripts all resolve
  an id to the first match, so a second field with the same id cannot be labelled
  at all. Reports once per duplicated id rather than once per copy: a template
  rendered twice can repeat forty ids, and forty findings about one cause is a
  wall rather than a report.
- `tabindex-positive` — a positive tabindex does not nudge an element earlier, it
  moves it into a queue the browser visits before the whole page. One of them
  makes the first Tab press jump past the navigation.
- `viewport-scaling-disabled` — `user-scalable=no`, or a `maximum-scale` under 2,
  which fails 1.4.4's 200% requirement. Nearly always cargo-culted from an era of
  mobile browser bugs that no longer exist.
- `text-blinking` — `<blink>` and `<marquee>`. Survives mainly in imported
  content, where nobody notices because no current browser renders `<blink>`.
- `text-justified` — declared inline or via the old `align` attribute. Only what
  the markup says is visible from the server, so an empty result is not a
  statement about the site's stylesheets.
- `underline-not-a-link` — underlining means "link" to every reader, so people
  try to click it. Needs review rather than settled: HTML names real uses for
  `<u>`, and a check cannot tell those from emphasis applied by habit.
- `bold-text-as-heading` — a short, entirely bold paragraph with no closing
  punctuation, which is how most pages end up looking structured while having no
  outline at all.
- `video-needs-captions` — no caption or subtitle track declared. Needs review:
  burned-in captions and player-supplied captions leave no trace in the markup,
  and video embedded from YouTube or Vimeo sits inside an iframe where nothing
  here can look.
- `audio-needs-transcript` — reports every `<audio>` element, because nothing
  distinguishes a transcript from any other paragraph. A prompt, not a verdict,
  and the wording says so.

### Fixed

- `bold-text-as-heading` reported this plugin's own draft-statement banner — a
  bold line correctly marked up inside `role="note"`. `DogfoodTest` caught it
  before it shipped, which is what that test exists for. The rule now skips
  paragraphs in callouts, list items, table cells, captions, and anything within
  four levels of an explicit `role`: a `role` attribute means somebody has
  already decided what that region is.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-06

Twelve new checks. The scanner goes from 17 to 29 — 24 on the server, 5 in the
browser.

### Added

**Images**

- `img-alt-is-filename` — alt text that is the file name, a placeholder word, or
  the `src` with its punctuation tidied. Worse than a missing attribute in one
  specific way: it looks answered, so no other check will ever flag it.
- `img-alt-too-long` — over 150 characters. Reported as needing review rather
  than settled, because long alt text is not a WCAG failure; it is a signal the
  content might belong in a caption, where it can be skimmed and re-read.
- `img-alt-redundant` — alt matching the caption or the `title` word for word,
  so the same sentence is announced twice. Exact matches only: alt that
  *overlaps* a caption is usually two jobs done well.
- `image-map-area-alt-missing` — an `<area>` is the one kind of link with
  nowhere to put visible text, so its `alt` is the only name it can have.

**Links**

- `link-opens-new-window` — `target="_blank"` with no mention of it in the link
  name or title. Reported as needing review: WCAG has no criterion a bare
  `_blank` fails outright, and saying otherwise would be overstating it.
- `link-to-file` — links to PDFs, Office documents, archives and media whose
  text does not name the format. Deliberately one rule where the obvious
  competitor ships three, because it is one habit with one fix and naming the
  format in the message is more useful than sorting findings by it.
- `link-anchor-broken` — `href="#thing"` where nothing has that id. Matters most
  for skip links, which stay visible, still look right, and silently do nothing
  once their target is renamed.
- `link-not-keyboard-reachable` — an `<a>` with a click handler but no `href`,
  which the browser treats as a span: not focusable, not in the links list, not
  activated by Enter. Narrow on purpose, so bare named anchors are not swept up.

**Structure, forms and ARIA**

- `heading-empty` — announces "heading level two" and then nothing. Alt text
  inside the heading counts as text, because that is what alt text is for.
- `page-has-no-headings` — no headings at all, so there is no list to jump
  through and the page can only be read from the top.
- `form-label-orphaned` — a `<label for>` pointing at a missing id, or two
  labels on one field. Both look correct on screen and neither is.
- `aria-reference-broken` — `aria-labelledby` and its six siblings pointing at
  ids that are not on the page. A broken `aria-labelledby` does not just fail to
  add a name, it suppresses the one the element already had.

### Changed

- `EngineTest` now asserts that the number of rules that ran equals the number
  registered, rather than a hard-coded number. The engine deliberately swallows
  a throwing rule so one bad check cannot lose the findings of the other
  twenty-three — which means a rule that fatals is indistinguishable from a rule
  that found nothing. That assertion is the only thing that tells them apart,
  and it immediately caught two of these twelve calling `wp_parse_url()`, which
  the test harness did not stub.

### Fixed

- `wp_parse_url()` is now stubbed in `tests/TestCase.php`. Without it, any rule
  using it silently found nothing under test while working correctly in
  production.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-06

The plugin becomes one free thing. There is no paid tier, no licensing SDK, and
no AI.

### Removed

- **The licensing SDK, entirely.** The vendored SDK (3.9 MB), the opt-in screen
  and its email flow, `Support\Plan`, the tier checks on the two paid routes, the
  free-build and tier guards, and the free/premium split in `bin/build.sh`.
  There is one build now, and what is tested is exactly what ships.
- **The AI layer, entirely.** `src/AI/` and its four provider adapters, the
  WordPress AI Client bridge, the encrypted key store, the daily usage meter,
  alt-text generation, the generative fix path (`FixManager`, `FixController`,
  `fix-action.js`), and the AI settings screen. The plugin now makes no
  outbound request of any kind. Nothing is metered because nothing is paid for
  per page.
- `uninstall.php` stays absent and the cleanup stays on `register_uninstall_hook`.
  The reason changed — it was a deployment rule of the licensing SDK, and is now
  simply that WordPress runs that file *instead of* the hooks — but the guard in
  `UninstallTest` is the same one.

### Added

- **An Images screen.** Every image in the media library that has never been
  described, listed with a field beside each, a per-row save and a save-all.
  Writes `_wp_attachment_image_alt` — WordPress's own field, not an override —
  so a description applies wherever that image is used, is read by every theme
  and plugin without knowing this one exists, and survives this plugin being
  deleted. A fix that only works while our code is installed is not a fix.
- A "decorative" checkbox, and a refusal to write an empty description without
  it. An empty alt is a real answer that tells a screen reader to skip an image;
  it is also what an empty field looks like, and writing one by accident hides
  a real image from somebody who needed to know it was there.
- Images already marked decorative are excluded from the list, so a deliberate
  decision is never offered up for overwriting.

### Changed

- **Site-wide scanning is free.** It was the paid line. Held against a free
  competitor that also charges for it, the sharper position is not to — and
  bulk scanning is a poor thing to rent, because it is a job most sites need
  once. What a subscription should be for is work that recurs.
- The six rules that declared `FixKind::Generative` now declare `Manual`. That
  is not a downgrade so much as an admission: what an image is for, what a link
  promises, what a button does are questions about intent, and with nothing
  drafting an answer they are exactly what `Manual` has always meant. They move
  from "Read, then apply" to "Needs a decision from you".
- `FixKind::Generative` and `ActionBand::Review` are both kept although nothing
  can now produce either. `Review` is a stored value on issue rows, so removing
  it would strand anything an older version wrote; and the distinction the pair
  draws — between a fix that is computed and a fix that is merely plausible —
  is the thing that stops the two ever sharing a button.

### Fixed

- `Queue` no longer carries the alt-text run's hook, group and enqueue methods,
  which scheduled work for a handler that no longer exists.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- The findings list offered an AI button for the three findings a stylesheet
  answers. It chose between the fix actions on `detection` alone — which says
  whether a machine settled a finding, not whether answering it needs a model —
  so colour contrast, links marked by colour alone, and targets under 24 by 24
  were sent to a provider and stopped at "No AI provider is set up yet",
  directly beneath a heading promising there was one correct answer and nothing
  was a guess.

  They now hand off to the page view, which has had the deterministic fix all
  along. That is where it belongs rather than a workaround: the declarations are
  measured off the live element's computed colour and rendered size, and the
  list has no rendered page to measure. The decision reads from the shared
  `CSS_FIXABLE` list rather than a second copy, so the two cannot drift.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-02

### Changed

- Uninstall cleanup moved off `uninstall.php` and onto an uninstall hook, and
  the file removed. The licensing SDK refused a deployment whose main folder
  contained one, for a reason worth recording: WordPress runs `uninstall.php` *instead of*
  the uninstall hooks, so the file would have stopped the SDK ever seeing the
  uninstall. The cleanup now runs on the SDK's `after_uninstall`, which also
  declines to fire while the other flavour of the plugin is still installed —
  so removing the free copy can no longer delete data the paid one is using.
  Without the SDK, `register_uninstall_hook()` covers the same ground.

  This also meant dropping the `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` guard: core defines that
  constant only in the `uninstall.php` branch, so on the hook path it would have
  made the cleanup exit immediately and delete nothing while still looking
  correct. Pinned by tests, since it fails silently.

  Note this supersedes the scaffold step in SPEC.md and CLAUDE.md, both of which
  still call for an `uninstall.php`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-01

Phase 3, final third: the editor, the theme, and the paid line.

### Added

- **An accessibility panel in the block editor**, checking what you write as
  you write it. The content is already in the browser, structured, so there is
  nothing to fetch — no permalink, no preview nonce, and no loopback request,
  which matters most on the hosts where loopback fails. Blocks are checked
  individually and findings come back keyed to the block that produced them:
  attributing a finding by matching markup afterwards is a heuristic, and asking
  about one block at a time makes it a fact.
- **Fixes written into the block itself.** Setting alt text on an image block
  writes the block's own attribute, so the correction is in the post content,
  visible immediately, and undone with the editor's own undo. Not an override
  and not a filter — the first place this plugin does real remediation rather
  than reversible interception, and it does not depend on the plugin staying
  installed.
- **The rendered queue.** A finished bulk run can now go on to check colour,
  size and layout by working through the pages one frame at a time in the
  administrator's own browser. Because it is their session, drafts and private
  pages work with no token scheme and no authentication bypass to design. It
  cannot be scheduled — a cron job has no browser — and that is stated before it
  starts rather than discovered when the tab closes.
- **Theme triage.** Most accessibility faults on a real site are in the theme,
  and this plugin cannot edit a theme. Each finding is now sorted by what would
  actually fix it: a setting the owner already has, or a change for whoever
  maintains the theme, with a plain-text hand-over document written out for the
  second. The setting tier is used only where identification is certain — the
  site logo is matched against the attachment WordPress records as the logo, and
  menu items by the class core's own walker writes.
- **The paid boundary, and a guard for it.** `bin/check-tiers.php` asserts that
  every paid route refuses a free site, with the check near the top of the
  handler before any work. A route that forgets its gate works perfectly, passes
  every test, and gives the product away silently; nothing else in the
  repository would notice.

### Changed

- Menus in the theme report link to the screen the active theme actually uses.
  Appearance → Menus is not merely the wrong page on a block theme — it is
  frequently not registered at all, and a link that 404s is worse than none.

### Fixed

- **Two accessibility faults in this plugin's own interface**, found by auditing
  the six screens Phase 3 added. The progress bar's track was 1.49:1 against the
  panel behind it, where SC 1.4.11 wants 3:1; it now carries a hairline outline,
  because every track colour dark enough to clear 3:1 lands within 1.5:1 of the
  fill. And the post-type filters claimed `role="tablist"` while implementing
  none of the tab pattern — no `aria-controls`, no tabpanel, no roving tabindex,
  no arrow keys — which is worse than plain buttons, since a screen reader
  announces "tab, 1 of 2" and the arrow keys do nothing.
- The rendered queue unmounted the moment its last page reported, so the one
  thing worth reading — how many pages refused to open, and were therefore never
  checked for colour — appeared for a few milliseconds and vanished.
- Switching a paid feature on could not take effect in the request that did it.
  `add_theme_support( 'title-tag' )` is refused after `wp_loaded`, which every
  REST request is past, so the "helpful" immediate call achieved nothing except
  a `_doing_it_wrong` notice on any site with debugging on.

### Notes

- The contrast guard grew from 60 pairings to 91, covering every colour Phase 3
  introduced against the panel it actually sits on rather than against white.
- `docs/accessibility-audit.md` was re-run and re-dated. Its "what has not been
  checked" section grew as well: the editor panel has still never been opened in
  a block editor, and the audit says so rather than implying coverage.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-01

Phase 3, middle third: what to do about a finding, and doing it to many things
at once.

### Added

- **Every rule now declares what can be done about it** — whether the fix is
  computed or generated, and where it would be written. Both halves matter: a
  one-click fix needs a known answer *and* somewhere we can write it, and
  several rules have the first without the second. `lang="en"` has exactly one
  correct value and lives on an element printed by the theme.
- **Plain language.** Every check carries one sentence on what it costs an
  actual person — "a screen reader announces this as button and nothing else" —
  shown above the technical message rather than instead of it. A test bans
  specification vocabulary from those sentences.
- **Findings are grouped by what they ask of you** rather than by severity: fix
  now, read then apply, decide for yourself, or hand to whoever maintains the
  theme. Cheapest first. Sorting by severity opens a real page with the most
  serious problem on it, which is very often in the theme and not the reader's
  to fix — and a list that opens with "ask your developer" is a list people
  close.
- **Bulk scanning**, by post type, with selection and a two-state badge.
  "Content checked" and "Fully checked" are worded to be told apart, because a
  bulk run reads content and cannot check colour, size or layout.
- **Findings can be set aside as not problems, with the reason required.** Every
  scanner produces some of these, and a tool with no way to say so leaves a
  permanently dirty list that people stop reading. But these records are what a
  conformance document is built from, so a dismissal needs a sentence, an author
  and a date — and reopening keeps all three.
- **Bulk alt text**, generated in the background and approved on one screen.
  Alt text describes the image itself, so it applies wherever that image
  appears, under any theme, and it outlives this plugin. Bulk here means one
  screen instead of forty modals; it does not mean nobody reads them.
- A deterministic fix for a missing `<title>`: WordPress composes the right
  answer already, and the only reason it is absent is that the theme never asked
  for it.

### Changed

- Staleness is worked out by comparing timestamps rather than recorded on save.
  A stored flag needs a hook on every write path — the editor, REST, WP-CLI, an
  import, a scheduled publish — and the one that gets missed leaves a page
  claiming coverage it no longer has.

### Fixed

- A finding reported a control as "170 by 24 pixels" and then asked for 24 by
  24. The measurement was rounded and the comparison was not, so the tool read
  as broken.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-01

Phase 3, first third: work that survives being interrupted.

### Added

- **A background queue.** Bulk work runs through Action Scheduler rather than
  inside an admin request. A run is a parent scan row with one child per page,
  written before any work happens: progress is a count rather than a number
  somebody remembered to increment, and resuming after a timeout needs no cursor
  because the rows still marked queued *are* the cursor.
- **Runs can be stopped**, and everything already found is kept. Cancellation is
  checked in the worker as well as unscheduled in Action Scheduler, because
  unscheduling races with a runner that has already claimed a batch.
- **A separate fetch strategy for bulk.** One loopback request per permalink is
  right for one page and wrong for two hundred: it fails per page rather than
  once, it has no user so a queued job fetching a draft gets a 404, and it makes
  the site render itself a second time for every page scanned. Bulk now reads
  post content in process, which needs no HTTP and therefore works on hosts that
  block loopback, inside cron, and on drafts.
- **The theme is checked once**, against a handful of representative pages,
  with what it finds filed against the theme rather than repeated against every
  page that uses it.
- **A template profile**, so a content-only scan is not blind to what the theme
  puts above it. Without it, two heading rules quietly under-report on exactly
  the well-built themes where the remaining faults are subtle.

### Changed

- **The minimum WordPress version is now 6.8**, raised from 6.6. Action
  Scheduler 4.x requires it, and 4.1.0 carries hardening against object
  injection when deserializing stored schedule data that was never backported to
  the 3.9 line. The choice was an older floor or a queue missing a security fix
  its own authors thought worth making.
- Whether the site can fetch its own pages is established once and cached rather
  than rediscovered per page. A hundred-page run previously spent half an hour
  learning one fact and then reported it a hundred times.

### Notes

- Action Scheduler by Automattic is now bundled. It is GPLv3-or-later; this
  plugin's own code remains GPLv2-or-later, and the two combine in that
  direction. It makes no outbound requests of its own.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-31

Phase 2, step 2: the browser pass stops being a pass that only reports. Plus the
admin redesign.

### Added

- **CSS remediation for the findings an override cannot reach.** Three of the
  five browser-pass rules can be answered by a style rule — contrast, links
  marked by colour alone, and undersized targets — and now are. The inspector had
  been finding these and then offering nothing but an explanation, which on a
  representative page meant fourteen of nineteen findings were a dead end.

  Rules go into WordPress's own Additional CSS rather than a stylesheet of ours.
  That keeps the "nothing for visitors" line intact, and it puts the change
  somewhere the site owner can read, edit or delete with or without this plugin
  installed. A fix only we can undo is a fix that holds the site hostage.
  Everything outside our marker block is preserved byte for byte.

- **The selector is part of the review, because the blast radius is.** A markup
  override touches one element in one post; a CSS rule touches everything it
  matches, on every page, forever. So the proposal shows the selector, makes it
  editable, counts what it matches in the live frame, and says plainly when it
  had to fall back to a positional selector that will break as the content moves.
  Preference order is id, then a single class, then position — biased towards the
  class, because a colour that is wrong here is usually wrong everywhere that
  class is used.

- **Verification by re-measurement.** After a rule is applied the frame is
  reloaded and the same measurement taken again, so "applied" and "it worked" are
  reported as the different things they are. A rule can be written perfectly and
  still lose to a more specific selector in the theme; that case now reads
  "Applied, but it did not take effect" rather than being quietly counted as a
  fix.

- **Contrast proposals that a designer will keep.** `nearestAccessible()` moves
  lightness only, keeping the hue and saturation somebody chose, and stops at the
  first value that clears the threshold rather than reaching for black. Worth
  recording: at the AA thresholds this always has an answer. Lightness 0 and 1
  are black and white whatever the hue, and the worst background in the entire
  colour space still leaves one of them at 4.58:1 — confirmed by brute force over
  the space, not assumed.

### Changed

- Redesigned the admin screens around the WOWStudio mark. Every colour was
  measured before it was given a job: the lavender at 2.08:1 is used for
  gradients and never behind a word, the indigo at 6.65:1 carries actions and
  links, the navy at 14.02:1 carries headings. The contrast guard grew from 52
  pairings to 60, all passing.
- Renamed the admin menu entry from "Accessibility" to "Accessibility Kit",
  which said nothing about whose plugin it was and collided with every other
  accessibility plugin in the menu.
- The two browser-pass rules a stylesheet genuinely cannot answer — a scrolling
  region with nothing focusable in it, and an `aria-hidden` element still in the
  tab order — now explain themselves individually instead of sharing a generic
  refusal. Both need an attribute added to the markup. A reader told a fix is
  coming waits for it; a reader told to edit their template goes and does it.

### Fixed

- **A finding whose measurement contradicted its own verdict.** A navigation link
  23.6 pixels tall was reported as "This control is 170 by 24 pixels. It needs to
  be at least 24 by 24" — the message rounded and the comparison did not, so the
  tool read as broken and sent people looking for a width problem that was not
  there. The message now names the dimension that actually failed and keeps the
  fraction that explains it.

### Security

- The declarations for a CSS fix arrive over REST from a page we do not control,
  so nothing in the request is trusted to describe itself. Which rule is being
  answered, which properties that rule may set, and what a selector may contain
  are all decided server-side, and every value passes core's
  `safecss_filter_attr` as well. Applying requires core's `edit_css` in addition
  to `wsak_apply_fix`: this must never become a way to change site-wide CSS for
  somebody who could not already do it by hand. Verified against the live
  install by attacking it — a markup finding routed to the CSS endpoint, a
  `position: fixed` smuggled into a contrast fix, and a selector carrying
  `.a { } body { display: none }` were all refused with nothing written.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-30

Phase 2, step 1: the scanner learns to see the page, not just read it.

### Added

- **A second scanning pass that runs in the browser**, checking the things no
  parser can know because they only exist once a page has been rendered: real
  text contrast, real target sizes, links distinguished by colour alone,
  scrollable regions no keyboard can reach, and elements hidden from screen
  readers but still focusable.
- **The inspector** — findings on the left, a live preview of the page on the
  right, and choosing a finding highlights the element it is about. Selectors are
  verified against the recorded markup before anything is highlighted: pointing
  at the wrong element is worse than pointing at none, because it looks
  authoritative and is silent when wrong.
- Contrast that cannot be determined — text over a photograph, a gradient,
  stacked translucency — is reported as needing a person, with the reason. A tool
  that guesses there produces a confident pass on text that may be invisible.

### Changed

- The browser pass is our own implementation rather than axe-core. Two engines
  reporting the same problem twice would be worse than useless to the person
  reading the list, and every check we run has to be one we can explain in our
  own words and stand behind in the coverage panel.
- The quality gate now states a verdict per step instead of implying one. It was
  possible to read a passing line above a failing one and conclude the run was
  clean — which happened.

### Fixed

- **Moving across the findings list yanked the page around.** `scrollIntoView`
  scrolls every scrollable ancestor, and the element lives in an iframe, so it
  dragged the admin page underneath to bring the frame into view — made worse by
  the preview pane being sticky. The frame now scrolls itself, only when the
  element is actually out of sight, and only after the pointer has settled. A
  regression test fails the build if `scrollIntoView` is ever called again.
- **Static analysis failed on a fresh checkout, including CI's first ever run.**
  `Core\Assets` require()s `build/index.asset.php`. The runtime behaviour is
  correct — the require is guarded by `file_exists()` and an admin notice
  explains a missing build — but PHPStan resolves the path statically and errors
  when the file is absent. `build/` is generated and gitignored, so it is absent
  on any fresh clone; the check only ever passed locally because a build was
  already sitting there. The `php` job now builds the admin bundle before
  analysing.

  Worth knowing when reproducing this: PHPStan caches results, so a stale cache
  reports the error after the build is back. `vendor/bin/phpstan
  clear-result-cache` first.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-30

Phase 1, step 9: the QA gate. One real security finding, the i18n hole that let
it hide, and the WordPress.org disclosure that should have shipped in 0.5.0.

### Security

- **An unauthenticated caller could enumerate which post IDs existed, drafts
  included.** `POST /wsak/v1/scan` checked post existence and readability in the
  argument's `validate_callback`. WordPress runs argument validation *before*
  `permission_callback`, so that check answered anonymous callers — and answered
  them differently: "you do not have permission to read that content" for a post
  that existed, "that content could not be found" for an ID that did not. Titles
  and content were never exposed, only existence, but walking the integers
  mapped every private and draft post on the site.

  The check now runs in the handler, behind `can_scan()`. Anonymous callers get
  an identical 401 for every ID; a subscriber gets an identical 403; only a
  caller already entitled to scan can tell 404 from 422.
  `ScanControllerTest::test_no_argument_validator_performs_authorisation` fails
  the build if any route argument regains a `validate_callback`, because the
  rule worth encoding is the blunt one: validators check shape, handlers decide
  access.
- Full review recorded in `docs/security-review.md` — authorisation, SQL,
  secrets, escaping, CSRF, transport, uninstall, and a list of what was not
  checked.

### Fixed

- **JavaScript translator strings were not linted at all.** The i18n rules ship
  with `@wordpress/eslint-plugin` but are not in the config `wp-scripts lint-js`
  loads by default, and CI never ran `lint:js` in the first place. A translator
  call missing its text domain passed lint, passed the build, and was then
  dropped from the `.pot` in silence, because `make-pot` extracts only calls
  carrying the domain it was given — leaving the string permanently
  untranslatable with nothing anywhere saying so. Confirmed by removing a domain
  and watching the string vanish from the template. `eslint.config.cjs` now
  enables the i18n rules with the plugin's domain, and CI runs `lint:js` and
  `lint:css`.
- `(%d)` was declared with `_n()` and identical singular and plural forms, which
  costs every translator a plural form that can never differ, and carried two
  different translator comments for one string. Now a single `__()` with one
  comment. Same for "You can contact %s.", which had two comments.
- The translation template was stale. Regenerated: 311 strings, no warnings.
- **The CI check for a stale translation template could never pass.** It ran
  `make-pot` and then `git diff --exit-code`, but WP-CLI stamps
  `POT-Creation-Date` with the current time on every run, so the file always
  differed from the committed one whether or not a string had changed. The step
  would have failed on the first push — it has not bitten yet only because
  nothing has been pushed. `bin/makepot.sh` now strips that header, which makes
  the template reproducible; verified both ways, that two consecutive runs agree
  and that a changed string is still caught.

### Added

- `== External services ==` in readme.txt. Required by WordPress.org whenever a
  plugin contacts a third party, and missing since the provider adapters landed
  in 0.5.0 — submitting without it is a rejection. Covers all four providers,
  the exact endpoint each request goes to, what is sent and when, the
  300-character cap on page context, the `_wsak_skip_ai` opt-out, the site's own
  AI switch, and the licensing SDK's telemetry.

### Verified

- PHPCS clean across 94 files; PHPStan level 6 clean; 132 tests, 361 assertions.
- Plugin Check: **0 errors** against the built plugin. All 9 warnings are known:
  2 assembled-SQL statements and 7 direct-provider calls, both re-read for this
  review and documented in the release checklist. (The checklist had recorded
  five provider warnings; there are seven.)
- Free zip audited as a **zip**, not just as a source tree: 70 PHP files, no
  premium-only code, no licensing gatekeeper secret.
- Every route called unauthenticated and as a subscriber; none returned data.

### Notes

- The terms and privacy-policy links in the new readme section were written from
  knowledge and have not been fetched. The endpoint URLs come from the adapters
  and are correct. Checking the policy links is a release-checklist item.
- `composer test` needs PHP 8.1–8.4; Brain Monkey does not run on 8.5, which is
  what a current Homebrew PHP installs.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-30

Phase 1, step 8: dogfooding. No new features — this step holds the plugin's own
surfaces to the standard it reports on, and makes both halves of the honesty
rule mechanical rather than a matter of review.

### Added

- `docs/accessibility-audit.md` — the audit of our own admin UI against WCAG 2.2
  AA: what was checked, how, what was found, and, at length, what has **not**
  been checked. Section 4 is the one to read before quoting any of the rest.
- `tests/Unit/DogfoodTest.php` — the accessibility statement, in every
  configuration it supports and both signed off and not, is scanned by the
  plugin's own engine and must come back clean. It also asserts the checks
  really ran, so the suite cannot pass silently if the rule registry is ever
  emptied by accident.
- `bin/check-disclosures.php` — asserts 17 required disclosures across 10
  conformance surfaces are still present. The companion to `check-claims.php`:
  that one stops us saying what we must not, this one stops us quietly dropping
  what we must say. The caveat under the score, the coverage lede, the warning
  above a suggested fix and the draft banner are all ordinary strings that a
  routine refactor could delete without breaking a test.
- `bin/check-contrast.js` — reads the palette out of `style.scss` and computes
  the real ratio for all 41 foreground/background pairings the admin UI renders,
  each at the size and weight it is actually rendered at. All 41 meet WCAG 2.2
  AA. Also available as `npm run lint:contrast`.

### Fixed

- **Focusable code blocks had no accessible name.** The issue-context and diff
  blocks are `tabindex="0"` so their overflow can be scrolled without a mouse,
  but landing on one announced raw markup with no indication of what it belonged
  to. Both now carry `role="group"` and a naming `aria-label` — a group rather
  than a region, because a page with thirty findings would otherwise add thirty
  landmarks to the list a screen reader user navigates by. (SC 4.1.2, 2.4.6)
- **The statement preview competed with the panel around it.** It injected its
  own `<h2>Accessibility statement</h2>` into a screen that already had one, so
  the outline showed two identically-named headings at the same rank and the
  preview's sections read as siblings of the panel's own. `StatementGenerator::render()`
  now takes a heading offset, clamped to 0–3 so output can never exceed `h6`;
  the published statement is unchanged and the preview nests below it. (SC 1.3.1)
- **Three live regions announced nothing.** Fix applied, fix undone and alt text
  saved each mounted a `role="status"` element with its text already in it, and
  a live region has to be in the document *before* its content changes or the
  announcement goes to a node the screen reader was not yet watching. Both
  components now keep one always-mounted, initially-empty region and write into
  it. (SC 4.1.3)
- `bin/check-claims.php` read `$argv`, which is not defined when
  `register_argc_argv` is off, so `composer lint` failed static analysis before
  reaching the tests. It reads `$_SERVER['argv']` now.

### Notes

- Contrast is measured but stacking is not: the guard checks the pairings named
  in its list, and a newly coloured element has to be added to that list to be
  covered. Same for `check-disclosures.php` and new conformance surfaces. Both
  guards are only as complete as their lists.
- The admin dashboard has still not been driven in a browser with axe-core, nor
  tested with any screen reader, nor tested with disabled users. Sections 3 and
  4 of the audit are explicit about which claims rest on source review rather
  than observed behaviour.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 7: the accessibility statement generator.

### Added

- A statement generator covering what the site owner says about their own site,
  the known problems, how to report a barrier, who to escalate to, and how the
  assessment was made.
- A `wowstudio/accessibility-statement` block and a
  `[wsak_accessibility_statement]` shortcode. Both render on the server from
  current settings, so a published statement can never be a stale copy of one.
- Sign-off: a named person records that they have read the statement and stand
  behind it.
- REST routes for reading, writing, signing off, and withdrawing.

### The honesty model

- **Nothing claims conformance on the owner's behalf.** Every conformance
  sentence begins with the organisation's name — "Example Ltd considers this
  website to be…" — because the plugin cannot verify any of it and should not
  appear to.
- **An unsigned statement publishes as a draft**, with a notice saying nobody
  has checked it. A document a plugin wrote is not a statement anybody made.
- **Editing withdraws the sign-off automatically.** An approved statement can
  never quietly come to say something its approver never read. Saving unchanged
  values does not withdraw it.
- **Sign-off is refused while the statement is unfinished** — no contact route,
  or a claim of partial conformance with no account of what falls short.
- **The limits of automated testing are stated in every rendering** and cannot
  be switched off, whatever status the owner selects.

### Fixed during development

- Adding the block silently stopped the admin app being built. wp-scripts
  discovers entry points from `block.json`, and once one existed it became the
  only entry — a successful build producing a blank dashboard. `webpack.config.js`
  now declares both entries explicitly. The `bin/build.sh` guard added in 0.4.0
  would have caught this at release; it is better caught here.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 6: one fix at a time, with preview, diff, apply, and undo.

### Added

- `wp_wsak_fixes` table, applied to an existing install by the versioned
  migration added in 0.2.0 — schema 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 with the other tables
  untouched.
- `Remediation\FixManager`: asks the configured provider for a corrected
  fragment, refuses proposals that change nothing or that balloon to several
  times the original, and records the result only when a person approves it.
- `Remediation\OverrideStore`: a non-destructive override layer. Applying a fix
  never edits post content. The correction is substituted as the page renders,
  so undo is a flag rather than a restore, and deactivating the plugin returns
  every page to its original markup by simply ceasing to filter.
- `Remediation\Diff`: a word-level comparison, returned as structured segments
  so the interface can label additions and removals in text rather than relying
  on colour.
- `generate_text()` on every provider, alongside the existing vision call.
- REST: preview, apply, revert, and list, all gated on `wsak_apply_fix`.

### Fixed during development

- The override layer was written as a string replacement, and it did not work.
  A scan reads the **rendered** page, where WordPress has already added
  attributes such as `decoding="async"`; the same element in post content
  carries fewer. The recorded markup therefore never matched byte-for-byte, and
  overrides stored cleanly and then silently did nothing. Caught by fetching a
  real page and looking at the img tag, not by any test.

  Matching now happens in the DOM (`Remediation\Substitution`) and is tolerant
  in one direction: a candidate matches when it is the same element and every
  attribute *it* carries also appears, with the same value, in the recorded
  markup. That accepts "WordPress added something on the way out" while still
  refusing to touch a genuinely different element. The filter also moved to
  priority 5, ahead of `wp_filter_content_tags`.

### Security

- Proposed markup is passed through `wp_kses` before it is stored. It came from
  a language model and will be substituted into a public page, so it is
  untrusted regardless of how carefully it was reviewed. Verified: a `<script>`
  tag in a proposal is stripped rather than stored.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- The plugin ignored `wp_supports_ai()`. WordPress 7.0 lets a site owner or host
  switch AI off through the `WP_AI_SUPPORT` constant or the `wp_supports_ai`
  filter, and we would have called a paid provider on a site that had explicitly
  said not to. The check now runs before any other work in the generation path,
  the settings screen explains the situation rather than silently failing, and
  the plugin does not work around the switch.

  WordPress before 7.0 has no such function, so its absence is treated as
  permission rather than refusal — otherwise AI would break on every site
  between 6.6 and 6.9.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 5: AI providers, encrypted credentials, and alt text.

### Added

- Bring-your-own-key providers for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and
  OpenRouter, behind a single `ProviderInterface`.
- `AI\AiClientBridge`, which prefers the AI client WordPress 7.0 ships when the
  site has one configured, so credentials do not have to be entered twice. The
  bridge is built against the real API, read from a WordPress 7.1 install.
- `AI\KeyStore`: keys encrypted with libsodium before they reach the database,
  with a fresh nonce per write. If libsodium is missing, storage is **refused**
  rather than silently downgraded to plaintext.
- Alt-text generation with a review step. The suggestion always lands in an
  editable field; nothing is written to the media library until a person saves
  it.
- The free allowance of 20 images a day, enforced in the generation path rather
  than in the interface, and consumed only after a provider actually answered.
- AI settings screen: provider, model, write-only key field, a plain statement
  of what is sent, and today's allowance.

### Privacy

- What leaves the site is the image, its file name, and — if the site leaves the
  toggle on — the page title and up to 300 characters of surrounding text. That
  list is the whole of `AI\ImageContext`; there is no other path out.
- A resized copy is sent rather than the original: cheaper, faster, and less
  data.
- Individual posts can be excluded with the `_wsak_skip_ai` post meta, checked
  before any work is done.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 4: the dashboard. The scanner now has a face.

### Added

- React admin app built with `@wordpress/scripts`, mounted on a single admin
  screen and loaded only there.
- Pick a page, run a scan, read the findings. Results are split into what the
  scanner settled and what still needs a person, with a count on each group.
- Score card that never shows the number alone: it sits beside the count of
  items awaiting review and a plain statement that it is not a measure of
  compliance.
- Coverage panel listing all twelve checks and what each can decide, with the
  limitation stated in the summary even when the detail is collapsed.
- `GET /wsak/v1/scans/<id>` and `GET /wsak/v1/scannable`.
- A design system in the WOWStudio palette. Contrast was measured rather than
  assumed: Indigo 6.31:1, Iris 5.70:1, Ink 17.9:1 all pass AA for body text.
  Cyan measures 1.80:1, so it is used only as a decorative accent and never for
  text or for information carried by colour alone.

### Fixed

- `wp i18n make-pot` ran against the built plugin, which excludes `assets/src`.
  Every string in the admin app — 61 of them — would have shipped
  untranslatable. `bin/makepot.sh` now copies the JavaScript sources in for the
  duration of the extraction.
- `bin/build.sh` now compiles the admin app and refuses to produce a build
  without it. `build/` is not in version control, so a release could otherwise
  ship a plugin whose admin screen is blank.
- `POST /wsak/v1/scan` did not return the post title, so the results heading
  read "Scan results" instead of naming the page.

### Accessibility

The dashboard was checked against the rules the plugin itself ships: zero
findings across 146 elements, one h1, and a heading outline that descends one
level at a time. Focus moves to the results heading when a scan finishes,
progress is announced through a live region, `prefers-reduced-motion` is
respected, and the layout reflows to a single column on small screens.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 3: the scanner. Findings are stored and available over REST; the
dashboard that shows them is step 4.

### Added

- PHP `DOMDocument`/`DOMXPath` scan engine, with a `Document` wrapper that
  handles parsing, UTF-8, accessible-name computation, and XPath escaping so no
  rule has to.
- Twelve MVP rules covering images, form labels, link and button names, frame
  titles, page language, document title, heading order, multiple top-level
  headings, table headers, and the main landmark.
- `RuleRegistry`, filterable through `wsak_rules`, exposing a `coverage()`
  report that says what each rule checks and whether it can settle the question
  automatically.
- `POST /wsak/v1/scan` and `GET /wsak/v1/coverage`, gated on `wsak_run_scan` and
  `wsak_view_reports` respectively.
- `PageSource`, which fetches the whole rendered page over a loopback request so
  the theme's markup is scanned, not just post content.

### Notes on honesty

- Eight of the twelve rules are auto-detected; four report `needs manual review`
  because confirming them takes human judgement. Vague link text, tables without
  headers, a missing main landmark, and multiple top-level headings are all
  cases where the markup alone does not settle the question.
- Only auto-detected findings reduce the score. Counting unconfirmed items as
  failures would report a page as worse than we know it to be, so the number is
  always shown next to the review count rather than on its own.
- When loopback requests are blocked, the scan falls back to post content and
  says so. The document-level rules detect the fragment and stay silent instead
  of reporting a missing page title that a fragment never had, and the response
  carries `full_page: false` with a `coverage_notice` explaining what was
  skipped and why.
- A rule that throws is logged and skipped rather than losing the findings of
  the other eleven.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 2: the storage layer. Still nothing user-facing beyond a holding
screen; the scanner that fills these tables arrives in step 3.

### Added

- `wp_wsak_scans` and `wp_wsak_issues` tables, created through `dbDelta` and
  versioned so later changes apply without an activation.
- `ScanRepository` and `IssueRepository`, with findings written as a single
  multi-row INSERT rather than one query per issue.
- Typed domain vocabulary as PHP 8.1 enums: `Severity`, `Detection`,
  `IssueStatus`, `ScanScope`, `ScanStatus`. The auto/manual honesty tag is a
  type rather than a loose string, because the UI has to keep the two apart
  everywhere it shows findings.
- `Scan` and `Issue` readonly records. An unrecognised value from a newer
  version degrades to a safe default instead of throwing, and an unrecognised
  detection degrades to "needs manual review" — when we cannot tell whether a
  machine settled something, the honest answer is that a person should look.
- `Core\Installer`, which installs on activation, on a site joining a network,
  and on a schema change. This closes the multisite gap left open in 0.1.0.
- Uninstall now drops the plugin's tables, still only when the site owner has
  opted in.

### Changed

- Every query uses `prepare()`'s `%i` identifier placeholder for table and
  column names, so no SQL in the plugin is assembled by string interpolation.
  The only exceptions are the `CREATE TABLE` statements, which `dbDelta` has to
  parse as literals.
- `Activator` now delegates per-site work to `Installer` so the activation and
  non-activation paths cannot drift apart.

### Added


### Fixed


## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

Phase 1, step 1: tooling and plugin scaffold. Nothing user-facing yet.

### Added

- Plugin bootstrap with headers, constants, and a graceful runtime requirements
  check that shows an admin notice instead of a fatal error on unsupported PHP
  or WordPress versions.
- PSR-4 autoloading and a thin `Plugin` orchestrator with a `Registrable`
  service contract, so no single class accumulates every hook.
- Four least-privilege capabilities (`wsak_manage_settings`, `wsak_run_scan`,
  `wsak_apply_fix`, `wsak_view_reports`) with a filterable role map. Editors can
  scan and read results but cannot change markup or settings.
- Activation that is safe to re-run and multisite-aware, and an uninstall
  routine that removes data only when the site owner has opted in. The default
  is to keep everything.
- Quality tooling: PHPCS (WordPress-Core, -Extra, -Docs, PHPCompatibilityWP),
  PHPStan level 6, PHPUnit with Brain Monkey, wp-env, and Plugin Check.
- `bin/check-claims.php` — fails the build on any unqualified "compliant",
  "certified", or "guaranteed" claim, enforcing the assist-never-guarantee rule
  mechanically rather than by review alone.
- `bin/build.sh` — builds the distributable plugin from `.distignore`, installs
  production-only Composer dependencies, and refuses to produce a build that
  contains development files.
- Translation template at `languages/wowstudio-accessibility-kit.pot`, with CI
  failing if it drifts from the source.

### Notes

- No `load_plugin_textdomain()` call. The `Domain Path` header lets WordPress
  load the bundled catalogue just in time, and calling it explicitly is what
  Plugin Check flags as discouraged since WordPress 4.6.
